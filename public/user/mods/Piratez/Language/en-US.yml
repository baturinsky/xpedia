  STR_SMALL_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: "This tiny craft is primarily used for reconnaissance or research. It normally precedes larger vessels at the start of a mission. It has a crew of one and little plunder value."
  STR_MEDIUM_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: "A small non-combat vessel that poses little threat to your craft. Used by Academicians and Traders in most missions. The crew ranges from 5 to 10 members, half of them civilian.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 39"
  STR_LARGE_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: "A general purpose vessel used by Academicians and Traders for more demanding missions. It can hold a crew of 7 to 19, always including an Engineer. Mostly harmless.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 52"
  STR_HARVESTER_UFOPEDIA: "Aptly named, the Shrine Ship is the primary vessel of the Church, and is sometimes commanded by a Reverend or even a Cardinal. It can hold a crew as small as 11 or as big as 31, armed with laser weapons and flamethrowers.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 10; SHIELDS: 200 (Reg x1); Max DPM: 172"
  STR_ABDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: "Although not really a warship, this vessel represents an elite level of technology and holds elite crew, so it's better not underestimated. It is normally used for special missions.{NEWLINE}SHIELDS: 500 (Reg x3); Max DPM: 175"
  STR_TERROR_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "This is just a large dropship. Its weapons might not be the most powerful around, but it is armored and can take a lot of punishment. However, shooting it down will grant a lot of infamy.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 5; Max DPM: 156"
  STR_BATTLESHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The Cruiser is amongst the largest and most powerful craft around, manned by the best-equipped personnel. To make things even worse, it was designed with boarding actions in mind and can be used to assault our Hideouts directly.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 25; Max DPM: 291"
  STR_SUPPLY_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "Supply Ships are used to fly regular supply runs to enemy Secret Bases. They are fast and hard to get once they manage to get close to their Base, but should yield significant booty (especially Hellerium) with only moderate risk if we manage to shoot down one."
  STR_ACCESS_LIFT_UFOPEDIA: "The access lift is always the first facility to be constructed at a new hideout. An easy guess what it does. Or so I hope. OK. It allows access - to both welcome and unwelcome guests. Especially the rude kind who, when you ignore the doorbell, blow the door out. It cannot be made fully secure, though, as we need the traffic of workers and thralls who live aboveground.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 1"
  STR_CORRIDOR_UFOPEDIA: "A simple 4-way passage with a central chamber, can be built to link outlying parts of a Hideout to the piping and power grid. It also grates off the sewers, making them impassable to enemies. It is equipped with a monitoring camera. To build more Corridors, we'll need to learn something about Electrics and Electronics."
  STR_FIRE_PIT_UFOPEDIA: "Anyone who carelessly strolls into this seemingly normal corridor will trigger firebombs hidden in its walls. Even if they don't roast the trespasser, they'll make them pause for a moment at least. Warning: the fuses aren't infallible and sometimes they'll fail to arm immediately."
  STR_GAS_CHAMBER_UFOPEDIA: "This room is equipped with hidden bombs, releasing powerful sleeping gas when someone walks close to them. Capturing prisoners has never been so easy, unless they wear gas masks, that is."
  STR_HYDROPONICS_UFOPEDIA: "With the help of the local farmers, and with the understanding of our Hideout's ecosystem, we have devised how to grow plants underground for food and profit. The well-known Zone plant, Uber Wheat, will be an ideal crop, it will grow fast on our Hellerium sludge, thus providing us with $100k monthly earnings. The humble Uber Wheat has many uses: it can be distilled into alcohol, fed to mutated Reapers (and to mutate Reapers), baked into Uber Bread and all sorts of delicious pastry! The flour is also very very explosive. It is possible we might learn more advanced forms of farming in the future..."
  STR_HYDROPONICS_WEED_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA: "Automation of lighting and watering allowed (alloweed?) us to master the growing of a notoriously difficult, yet very useful plant - the Sectoweed. Farming ain't for dumbheads and needs following certain steps:{NEWLINE}1) Construct Sectoweed Plantation, this needs 12 Sectoweed. It can be either constructed anew, or on top of an existing Plantation, the latter saves us $80k.{NEWLINE}2) When ready, 'Dismantle' it to change water and light regimen, fostering second phase of growth. This will cost $25k.{NEWLINE}3) When fully grown, 'Dismantle' again to harvest (costs $5k). This will net us 240 Sectoweed and leave behind a standard Plantation."
  STR_HYDROPONICS_BOOM_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA: "Growing Boom Fruit is challenging, as we need to make sure it doesn't blow the whole place up. This means higher costs and the need for stronger walls.{NEWLINE}1) Construct Boom Plantation, this needs 10 Boom Fruit & 10 Hellerium. It can be either constructed anew, or on top of an existing Plantation, the latter saves us $80k.{NEWLINE}2) When ready, 'Dismantle' it as normal, $50k cost.{NEWLINE}3) When fully grown, 'Dismantle' again to harvest (costs $10k). This will net us 100 Boom Fruit and leave behind a standard Plantation."
  STR_CASINO_UFOPEDIA: "A temple to human vice, built in cooperation with Jack. He funds the prizes and does the marketing, in exchange for half of the profits. The other half, however, is still a lot. What's more, this cooperation means we can exchange any Casino Coupons for real prizes here! Only one Casino can be built per Hideout, and establishing it requires a substantial amount of Credit Chips: 1 Obsidian, 6 Gold, 36 Silver, 216 Purple, 1296 Blue and 7776 Red. It will also cost 666 Glamour."
  STR_GAMBLING_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Jack is running a major gambling gig, so we figured out a foolproof plan: bring his slot machines to our Mess Halls and get rich! A play costs one $1000 Chip, and might grant us either a random Credit Chip, a fruit, some other trinket, or a Coupon of varied value. Until Jack likes us more, we'll be only able to cash in the lowest tiers."
  STR_STILL_UFOPEDIA: "A masterpiece of technology, a symbol of triumph of mind over matter, a place of happiness. All in one, albeit a bit smelly, facility. Without it present on-site, a Hideout cannot produce any alcoholic beverages. In addition to providing this functionality, it provides workspace for 5 Runts, but with no Workshops present, you can use it only to make alcohol. Requires an Extractor to be present.{NEWLINE}Building a new Still will require the Alchemy technology."
  STR_ONSEN_UFOPEDIA: "The healing qualities of hot springs are well known; it is ridiculous that we didn't realize its full potential earlier, despite sitting on a literal treasure tove of hot, healthy, glowing sludge! Add to this an almost equally healthy, mind-liberating atmosphere of Sectoweed fumes, and we have a facility which not only improves recovery rate of everyone in the Hideout by 0.5% of their max HP daily, and Refreshment rate to 9, but also serves as a cultural center! They say you shouldn't play or swim in the Onsen, but we're no dumb Sky Ninjas and can also use the Onsen as a small training center (up to 4 Hands)."
  STR_LUXURY_SPA_UFOPEDIA: "Besides the huge swimming pool (yaaay!), this facility contains all sorts of entertainment, recreational and training improvements: a fighting ring, a games terrace (with a great view), an arcade room, a sauna and more. It not only allows 40 hands to improve their physical fitness, but might be useful for training our auxilia as well, and generally increases the civilizational and sanitational level of a Hideout, thus improving wounds recovery by 0.65% of Max HP daily and Refreshment to 15. Dress code of this facility says 'the less, the better', a Swimsuit is the maximum allowed. Only a single Spa is allowed per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 4 Slaves and 6 Slave Maids."
  STR_GYM_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "This building houses a special, dangerous training course, which, aided by certain chemical substances, improves trainee's statistics on a daily basis. The facility consists of a shooting range (with targets that return fire), a boxing ring, some boring weights and last but not least, an arcade room! However, the course is very intensive and each Dojo can service only 8 Hands at a time. Wounded Hands do not benefit from the Dojo until fully healed. Dojo can't train stats past a certain threshold: 66 (Strength, Health, Throwing); 85 (TUs, Firing); 100 (Melee, Stamina). Reactions and Bravery aren't trained.{NEWLINE}The facility also boosts Hideout's Refreshment rate to 5."
  STR_LIBRARY_UFOPEDIA: "This luxury facility is used to store all kinds of books, paper, crystal and electronic, romance, adventure, erotica and even an occasional arcane work. It can serve as a workplace for a single Brainer, but what's more important, it's absolutely required for some of the more fancy Research and Manufacture projects to be even possible. However, good books are hard to find and extremely expensive, so establishing such a place is a major expenditure (a waste of money, some would say).{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 4"
  STR_GREAT_LIBRARY_UFOPEDIA: "Creation of such an exquiste place of learning would allow us to host no less than 23 knowledge-hungry Brainers, dedicated to uncovering all the secrets of nature, as the forever-elusive Lady of Nine Moons desires. Her secrets in particular. However, this will be impossible without her blessings; a Scroll of the Night, which supposedly can be found at underground Lokk'Naar shrines. We will also need no less than 777 Pillow Books to create the body of knowledge.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 6"
  STR_GDX_LAB_UFOPEDIA: "An advanced lab, built using Dr. X's knowledge (not as advanced as the ancient lab you have, though). Only a single one can ever be built. Provides workspace for 10 Brainers. Requires Surgery Room to be built."
  STR_RED_TOWER_UFOPEDIA: "The place where the Red Mage dwells. Provides functionality of Lab, Library and Summoning Circle. Up to 5 Brainers can work here."
  STR_MESS_HALL_UFOPEDIA: "No Hideout is complete without this establishment! It serves fresh drinks from the Still (requires one to function), slightly increasing wound recovery speed of our Hands (especially those with high Health). It is also a cultural centre, providing a proper forum for public discussion (we're no longer limited to the Hangar!) and workspace for 1 Brainer; without it, many cultural advances and some mission opportunities will be impossible to research. Only a single Mess Hall can be built per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 6"
  STR_LOVE_CLINIC_UFOPEDIA: "Here, our Gals can be treated by the eager personnel, while eating great food to the fullest. This results in miraculous rates of recovery! (I also heard that the nurses savagely whip any patients who try to outstay their healing process; it serves these simulants well!){NEWLINE}Only a single building of this type is allowed per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 600 Sectoweed."
  STR_MED_BAY_UFOPEDIA: "A general medical facility, that will speed up the wound recovery of all Hands in a Hideout - for a price. By healing an extra 0.5 HP per day, it effectively cuts the downtime by a third. Your Hands may complain that the recovery is being rushed, but they won't scoff at the company of nurses, instead of ol' tired faces in the bunkhouse. Only a single Sick Bay can be built per Hideout, but the health recovery bonus stacks with any bonuses provided by similar facilities (as if we know anything about this, ho, ho). Gives workspace for a single very eager Brainer.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 10 Medical Supplies."
  STR_SURGERY_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "This one requires a Library present to operate. Note the double meaning of the word, ha, ha. Anyhow. Various surgical procedures need such a specialized environment to be performed, allowing all wounded to recover extra 0.25 HP plus 1% of the soldier's Max HP daily, almost halving recovery times. This facility also houses 2 Brainers. Only a single Surgery Room is allowed per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 3 Surgery Units."
  STR_METAGARDEN_UFOPEDIA: "This establishment houses highly mutated plants, growing on Hellerium sludge, which grant us multiple benefits:{NEWLINE}>POWER. The green energy generates less income than a full-fledged Power Plant, has an equivalent functionality.{NEWLINE}>HEALING. Passive healing & Refreshment rate 9.{NEWLINE}>FOOD. By feeding the outside shantytown with tasty fruit, it creates a possibility to store additional 50 units of warez there.{NEWLINE}>DEFENSE. A special plant, the 'Tree of Life' allows detection of enemies (SENSE 18) and healing of our own. Additionally, facility's undergrowth is difficult to navigate.{NEWLINE}Only a single Metagarden per Hideout. 250 Sectoweed to build."
  STR_CLONING_CENTRE_UFOPEDIA: "This building will enable us to grow all sorts of living matter, from organs to whole organisms. Even if we haven't devised any creatures yet, it will help with medical care, recovering 0.75 HP daily to all Hands present on-site. The power of Creation is now ours to command! Up to ten Runts can work in this facility, which requires a Surgery Room present to operate. Only a single Cloning Centre is allowed per Hideout."
  STR_STUDY_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "If we want to seriously increase our research speed, building Study Rooms is our best bet. Each of these facilities allows 2 Brainers to work on any project of your choice. However, a Hideout intended to house them first needs at least one of each: Library, Surgery Room, Still (to help with abstract thinking) and Power Plant."
  STR_DATA_CENTER_UFOPEDIA: "Each of these facilities allows high-capacity data crunching, housing up to 4 Brainers. However, a central computer is needed to become a nucleus to Data Centre network (we can use the one in our Lab), and also a Library for reference materials. A Data Centre requires 6 Slave AIs to be built. A single Hideout can support up to three Data Centres."
  STR_COMPUTER_CORE_UFOPEDIA: "This facility houses a battery of obscenely-expensive, powerful computers, allowing us to crunch megatons of numbers. It can be used to conduct hacking, just like the Lab, and gives workspace for 4 extra Brainers. This extra brainpower may come in handy, as the facility is required (along with a Library) to pursue the 'Higher Studies' research project, that'll allow us to unlock even higher technologies, but is likely to be extremely slow to complete.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 20 Slave AIs. Only one per Hideout allowed."
  STR_REFINERY_UFOPEDIA: "Allows manufacture of Chemicals and advanced chemical weapons. Provides workspace for 10 Runts and lab space for 1 Brainer. Requires an Extractor present to be built."
  STR_MINT_UFOPEDIA: "Provides tools for making counterfeit money. Having it present at a Hideout allows you to ctrl+P all your financial problems away just like you were the Traders' Guild, how cool is that? Provides workspace for 10 Runts.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires an Industrial Scanner."
  STR_SUMMONING_CIRCLE_UFOPEDIA: "This arcane facility allows us to perform magic rites needed to get all sorts of magical stuff (not all magical stuff requires it, though). It provides workspace for 10 Runts for that purpose. It also provides workspace for 3 Brainers. Just be careful during Hideout Defenses, who knows what can be accidentally summoned amidst the ensuing chaos...{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 10 Hypno Pannels. Only a single Summoning Circle allowed per Hideout. Requires Library present."
  STR_POWER_PLANT_UFOPEDIA: "This facility, while quite expensive to build, immediately starts to be a cash earner since it can be used to power other facilities, and any excess electricity can be sold. On top of that, we need this facility for any manufacturing process that requires unusually high energy density.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 2 Ship Engines."
  STR_FUSION_REACTOR_UFOPEDIA: "There is little gain from understanding the containment field physics if we can't put it to practical use. A Fusion Furnace installed at a Hideout lets us manufacture ammunition and other equipment dependent on this technology. It additionally allows us to power the most advanced defensive facilities and provides research opportunities for 2 Brainers. However it needs a Power Station to run."
  STR_WELL_UFOPEDIA: "A place of industry, it has a shaft that reaches into the bowels of the Earth and allows us to extract various resources from the slimy nukage that keeps us all healthily radiated. It allows up to 20 Runts to produce various simple equipment. Take note that stuff requiring intricate tools, like firearms, cannot be manufactured here. Some projects take space, limiting the number of workers. A single Hideout can support at most 3 Extractors.{NEWLINE}WARNING: After a project is started ('AYE' was clicked), canceling it will destroy ALL components allocated. To avoid it, be sure to dismiss unwanted projects immediately by the 'BEGONE' button. The 'REFUND' button, if present, returns components and money."
  STR_INDUSTRIAL_PRINTER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a Workshop-type facility. While less space-effective than an equivalent of 4 Workshops (providing workspace for a mere 100 Runts), it is definitely more cost-effective. Even more importantly, it allows manufacturing of items with very intricate internal structure, especially advanced armor suits.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 2 Industrial Scanners."
  STR_FACTORY_UFOPEDIA: "Look how far we've made it, Capn'. From a lousy, cramped hideout, to this - our own center of industrial production. It can provide workspace for up to 400 runts, while cutting operation costs by almost a half as compared to a Workshop when fully staffed. A Factory requires a Power Station.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 500 Plastasteel."
  STR_BURROW_UFOPEDIA: "A stylish (and drafty) general-use cave dwelling. Can house up to 10 people, as well as 10 animals (tamed or otherwise). It also provides 25 storage space.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 3"
  STR_BEAST_DEN_UFOPEDIA: "A large cave that can hold up to 20 beasts and 50 units of storage. Simply perfect for those who believe there is no better Hideout defense than a battalion of dogs.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 2"
  STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_UFOPEDIA: "This is where we live, eat, recover from wounds and do all sorts of (better left unsaid) stuff to fight the endless boredom. Each block can hold up to 25 free people, be it Hands, Runts or Brainers.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 5"
  STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_SMALL_UFOPEDIA: "Small and cheap radar facility with 10 bunks and 25 storage space, ideal for backwater hideouts. It is of a budget variety, with a 650 nautical miles detection radius, yet it can detect any flying object within that radius with a 100% accuracy (in ideal conditions...) with scans being made every half hour sharp.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 4"
  STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "We have designed a larger and more efficient version of the Barracks, with extra creature comforts to boot (fresh from the Junkyard). It can house up to 135 people and contains a small storage (75 space). However, as all this junk is quite expensive, the facility is less than dirt-cheap.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 6"
  STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_ADVANCED_UFOPEDIA: "This state-of-the-art facility is environmentally sealed and, thanks to better ergonomics and top-notch creature comforts, allows us to squeeze 40 people in while still granting them good night's sleep - if that's what they want, that is. It also features a defensive laser cannon mounted on top of it, and a tracking radar. Still it is encouraged to send the occupants to off-barracks activities as often as possible, there is only that much overcrowding people can take before they start killing each other. Also +25 storage.{NEWLINE}Refreshment: 8"
  STR_GENERAL_STORES_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "Bigger is better, ain't it? These huge vaults allow us to store more loot than a statistical pirate can count (namely, 675 units). They also provide +25 workshop space."
  STR_GENERAL_STORES_ARMORED_UFOPEDIA: "This advanced storage facility can house 250 units of wares and/or warez, and is defended by an autonomous anti-aircraft mounting. It also provides +5 workshop space."
  STR_JAIL_UFOPEDIA: "Each cell block has space for 15 special guests who can be released for ransom - either normally (Fence), or after robbing them of their possessions first (with a better yield than from a dead corpse), if it's worth it; to do that, check the Robbery category in the Workshop. The numbers represent: 1. armor parts; 2. faction related stuff; 3. common merchandise. You will also get ransom money (in Blue Chips), but, since they're damaged goods, only half the normal value. To rob a prisoner, you need to interrogate them first. Interrogated prisoners, as long as they're honorable, are released in exchange for their information."
  STR_PRISON_UFOPEDIA: "This big ol' building can hold up to 100 prisoners. It is equipped with remote locks and electronic detection systems. Its guard tower can fire a small cannon at escaping - or incoming enemy ships."
  STR_LABORATORY_UFOPEDIA: "Oi Cap'n, here you see the fabled Science Lab of old we found in here! No touching stuff! It'll bite you! We can discover ancient and new secrets for you - all you need is to give us Brainers an order! This be a real treasure - here we have the tools to invent new stuff, make sense of old stuff and interrogate prisoners. If we had no Laboratory, we'd been just common bandits. We can cram inside up to 12 really expensive people before they'll start killing each other. Researched items will be destroyed or taken away by the Brainers, with rare exceptions.{NEWLINE}The Lab increases storage space by 50."
  STR_PERSONAL_LABS_UFOPEDIA: "The Brainers are fiercely territorial creatures, and while they were more than happy to have fun with our Lab, to get more serious work done we need to provide them with proper personalized space. This facility provides the 'Study' functionality, which lets us research more stuff, it also allows us to host 4 extra Brainers. However it is merely an expansion of Old Earth Lab and as such requires it to function. Only one per Hideout can be built. Constructing it requires 25 Superconductive Wire."
  STR_WORKSHOP_UFOPEDIA: "A real workshop, armed with modern tools, is needed to manufacture anything that looks more like a laser gun than a stone axe (to do the latter, an Extractor is enough, or sometimes even some unused space in a Still). Maximum capacity is 30 runts.{NEWLINE}There is, however, a limit to what manual labour is capable of, and constructing more than 1 Workshop per Hideout would be pointless. To increase our industrial power, we need to devise more advanced forms of manufacturing."
  STR_SMALL_RADAR_SYSTEM_UFOPEDIA: "Without radars, you are effectively blind. Or at least one-eyed, as detecting any prey would require patrolling the skies with your craft. This radar is a large version of a hi-resolution system mounted on crafts. A full sweep takes 30 minutes and automatically detects any craft within the range of 1250 nautical miles.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires the 'Communications' technology."
  STR_LARGE_RADAR_SYSTEM_UFOPEDIA: "With a range of 2000 nautical miles, this device covers a huge area, but costs helluva money. However, it can be also used to jam the navigational devices of landing enemy craft, hopefully making them crash."
  STR_FLAK_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "A decent-sized anti-aircraft cannon, or three, can fend off some less powerful ships from attacking our base. The facility also contains a defensive gun emplacement, useful in base defense."
  STR_SAM_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "This facility greets any unwelcome guests with a volley of Stingray missiles. A bit low damage for the cost, but a successful hit is assured. Includes a small crew compartment for 5 occupants."
  STR_MISSILE_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "A silo hosting Avalanche nuclear missiles, ready to greet any unwelcome guests. They'll obliterate smaller landing ships in a single salvo. However, the missiles have only a small window of opportunity to fire, unless we want to nuke our own base, and still, several hits are needed to destroy military-class vessels, and each of these silos will have only a single chance to fire."
  STR_LASER_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "A stationary battery of heavy lascannons might not be as imposing as a missile silo, but it is much more accurate and much cheaper to maintain. It also contains a defensive laser turret for when the enemy had made it inside the Hideout."
  STR_GAUSS_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "Compared to other defense systems, a railgun battery can boast high firepower but is quite expensive to maintain. Like all defensive cannons, it also houses a turret for enemy assault situations."
  AUX_XTURRET_CANNON_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "The turreted weapon housed by the Flak Cannon building. Protected by heavy armor, and oversseing all outgoing corridors, turrets are a major defensive asset. They have virtually unlimited ammunition. A destroyed turret will be quickly replaced, but the bill will occupy 25 storage space as collateral and incur $15k monthly fee until the payment is settled."
  AUX_XTURRET_LASER_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "The turreted weapon housed by the Laser Battery building. Protected by heavy armor, and oversseing all outgoing corridors, turrets are a major defensive asset. They have virtually unlimited ammunition. A destroyed turret will be quickly replaced, but the bill will occupy 25 storage space as collateral and incur $50k monthly fee until the payment is settled."
  AUX_XTURRET_GAUSS_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "The turreted weapon housed by the Gauss Battery building. Protected by heavy armor, and oversseing all outgoing corridors, turrets are a major defensive asset. They have virtually unlimited ammunition. A destroyed turret will be quickly replaced, but the bill will occupy 25 storage space as collateral and incur $100k monthly fee until the payment is settled."
  AUX_XTURRET_PLASMA_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "The turreted weapon housed by the Plasma Battery building. Protected by heavy armor, and oversseing all outgoing corridors, turrets are a major defensive asset. They have virtually unlimited ammunition. X-Plasma Turret employs Red energy shields (200 shield points, regeneration 50/turn) to further improve its staying power. A destroyed turret will be quickly replaced, but the bill will occupy 25 storage space as collateral and incur $300k monthly fee until the payment is settled."
  STR_ARMORY_UFOPEDIA: "Only a single facility is allowed per base, and it needs a Power Plant. It provides the hideout with unerring defensive fire, as well as 125 Storage and 10 Workspace units. Most importantly, it allows us to build unique items, available only here (such as Battle Tank M)."
  STR_GENERAL_STORES_UFOPEDIA: "All equipment, guns, munitions, treasures and assorted junk are placed in Vaults, including equipment assigned to craft in hangars. You won't be able to buy anything on the Black Market and any loot you get from the battlefield needs to be immediately sold while the Vaults are full. Each can hold up to 100 units of storage, which translates into 20 ship reactor cores or 500 rifle-sized guns. It also provides 5 workshop space."
  STR_ALIEN_CONTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "With the use of Stasis Pods, we can fit 40 prisoners into a small facility, while not having to worry about a thing in the world.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 40 Stasis Pods."
  STR_PLASMA_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "Plasma beam defenses provide powerful and efficient protection against incursion by hostile craft. However the facility can't run on a standard power grid and requires a Power Station to function. Also contains a defensive turreted plasma cannon, invaluable for sweeping the corridors."
  STR_FUSION_BALL_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "Fusion missiles are the ultimate in hideout defense. These missiles create an anti-matter implosion which destroys everything within a specific radius. However a Fusion Furnace is needed to power the facility."
  STR_GRAV_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "The Repulsor Beam slows enemy craft attempting to land near the hideout, allowing all defense systems to fire twice.  In practice this will double the effectiveness of any defense systems. A Fusion Furnace is needed to provide necessary power. And no, building multiples won't stack.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 30 Force Circuitry."
  STR_MIND_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "Containing a battery of Cloaking Devices we mount on our ships, this facility will drastically reduce the chances of our Hideout being spotted. Normally, the chances of being spotted rise with the number of buildings in the hideout (although there is only about 30% difference between the smallest Hideout and a fully built-up one); the Shroud will halve this chance. If we build two Shrouds, the chance will be reduced to 1/3rd, and so on - any number of them will stack, albeit with diminishing returns... but we theorize that building 21 Shrouds would render any Hideout fully undetectable.{NEWLINE}R-click on a Shroud to disable it."
  STR_PSIONIC_LABORATORY_UFOPEDIA: "Here we can assess the magical aptitude of all hands on deck and help them in further developing their sorcery. The actual magical potential (henceforth called VooDoo Mastery) is equal to the VooDoo Power times VooDoo skill, so do not expect much of those who have low Power; but they at least can learn some defense against enemy dark arts here, as VooDoo Defense is equal to V.Power plus some of V.Skill. A single Voodoo School can train up to 8 students.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 10 Hypno Panels."
  STR_HYPER_WAVE_DECODER_UFOPEDIA: "With this device installed, we no longer need to rely on fickle radar detection. The Decoder taps directly into encrypted communication channels and not only instantly pinpoints any craft in range, but also provides a lot of intelligence on it. The maximum range is 2000 nautical miles.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 6 Slave AIs."
  STR_HANGAR_UFOPEDIA: "Each hangar can accommodate one vessel. There are facilities for maintenance, refueling and repair for the assigned craft. Each vessel stationed at a hideout must have a free hangar assigned to it which cannot be used by any other vessel, even if the assigned vessel is out on a mission. Sorry, Cap'n. The pilots and their ground crew have their bizarre rules, and we either follow them, or grow wings.{NEWLINE}Each Hangar increases workshop space by 10."

Every turn, they will lose 1 point of Freshness (unless at very low Morale; letting it all out helps), or more, depending on armor. When they are at high Freshness percentage, they will receive bonuses to Morale, Stamina and Stun recovery. As their Freshness drops to half, these bonuses start to turn into maluses. At very low Freshness, our Hands won't regenerate full TUs and might even receive Stun damage. Freshness is replenished every night at the Hideout. The more luxurious it is, the better.

  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_01: "An alarm rang all across the Academy's secret lab. The test subjects were escaping."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_02_A: "Guards scrambled to restrain them, but the mutants, naive as they were, possessed far superior strength, speed, and motivation. And most importantly, they already laid their hands on some weapons. Explosions, fire, and chaos were spreading."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_02_B: "Unsure of everything but their desire to break free, the mutants made it to the landing pads. Hellerium burning in their veins and thoughts racing in their heads, they took a small transport craft. To their relief, Academy ships had very simple controls. Disabling the autopilot was as simple as hitting it with a hammer. Soon they were speeding into the night. They had escaped."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_03: "The night sky was vast and mysterious. For over a decade, the life of these young mutants was contained within the sterile corridors of the underground base; it was a regulated life of study, exercises and tests under the watchful, cold gaze of the all-female staff and its weird head scientist, Dr. X. Still, her obsession with their performance was the closest thing to human affection they knew since they were stolen from their villages in their early childhood. Neither life in these secluded villages deep within Uber Zones, nor the bedtime stories and dreams they shared in captivity, nor the sanitized knowledge fed to them by their teachers, could have prepared them for such freedom."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_04: "There was only a single clue as where to go now. Their leader had a dream about a woman with unnaturally violet eyes who provided a set of coordinates. Maybe it was insane to pin their hopes on a dream, but they'd already done it once before - a dream was what spurred them to break free. They had no other option now; they knew nothing else."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_05: "They made peace with their gods and followed through until the break of dawn. The vast mystery of darkness was replaced an endless expanse of strange vistas bathing in the morning sun; an abundance of possibilities and a sea of information that they couldn't make much sense of."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_06: "Nearing their destination, they saw sparse villages separated by swathes of wilderness. A quite standard landscape in these times, but it was all so new to them."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_07: "They landed in a desolate valley, a small band of ragged castaways with nothing but a dream quest. The only proof of it being real was a small, drill-shaped amulet they had. The amulet that turned out to be a key, fitting a keyhole they found half-buried in the ground. And when the key was turned, they could only watch in amazement as part of a hillside slowly began to open, exposing a cavernous entrance."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_08: "Inside they found an underground complex, seemingly abandoned for centuries. But to them it was a hidden fortress, a roof above their heads; and below it, they found a huge pool of Hellerium sludge. Their Uber mutant metabolism needed the energy of Hellerium to function, meaning the sludge made the complex habitable to them. It was a good place to set up a new village, and that is what they decided to do."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_09: "Life was simple in the first weeks; they met with local villagers, they hunted and traded, they made their new hideout a real home."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_10: "But the idyll couldn't last forever. A heavily armed convoy arrived in the valley. The arrivals said they spoke on behalf of local tribes, the Mutant Alliance, as well as governments of the planet. They said they represented an alliance of peoples tyrannized by the Academy and their ilk: Earthlings who sold out their souls to the Star Gods. The Star Gods, masters of a Stellar Empire the Earth was occupied by for many centuries now."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_11: "Negotiations were held. Why should the castaways be content with what they are, if they could become so much more? The hideout they'd found - especially the old laboratory inside of it - contained the power to change the world, even if only by a little. The visitors offered an alliance on one condition: if the mutants dared to act like real masters of the castle they found, and not just use it selfishly like common bandits. Alternatively, the mutants could vacate the facility and seek their fortunes elsewhere. Earth already had bandits aplenty, and was in a dire need of brave warriors instead."
  STR_CUTSCENE_INTRO_12: "They decided to stay, to agree to this attachment, gaining in exchange the means to make this hideout their safe harbor, from which they would fly to engage in adventure; and thus begins our story..."

Shooting civilians will do little to improve our fame, but might pay our bills."
  STR_VESSEL_POL_PATROL_UFOPEDIA: "The most common, and weakest, of Megapol's flying cars. Since nobody likes Megapol, putting down these so-called lawmen can only be a good thing to do. Like any Aircar, this one is somewhat evasive  (Dodge +10)."
  STR_VESSEL_BANDIT_MOSQUITO_UFOPEDIA: "The Bandits often fly such souped-up vessels, waiting for civilian shipping to appear so they can force it to land. Of course they have no chance in hell to find us, but we can surely find them. We'd better attack in overwhelming force, though, as this ship is pretty tenacious (Acc +25, Dodge +35)."
  STR_VESSEL_BANDIT_WASP_UFOPEDIA: "A popular Bandit vessel, used in their various nefarious activities. Shooting it down would only be doing everyone a favor, and the loot is free for our taking. Compared to military vessels, it is rather pathetic, but still pretty deadly against civilian shipping (Acc +10, Dodge +15)."
  STR_VESSEL_BANDIT_COBRA_UFOPEDIA: "A larger Bandit vessel, often flown by Hitmen and their gangs under the guise of doing Legitimate Business. Certainly, they have paid the right bribes, but not to us, and neither to our backers. Cobras attack very accurately (Acc +25, Dodge +15)."
  STR_VESSEL_NIN_1_UFOPEDIA: "These large Ninja vessels would prowl the airspace, looking for our Hideouts or crafts to intercept. They can somehow detect our cloaked ships from 750 miles away. They attack with long range rockets, slow to reload. Their weird shields will neutralize any single hit, but immediately fail afterwards (Acc +45, Dodge +40)."
  STR_VESSEL_TEC_01_UFOPEDIA: "A sleek, fully automated craft, aparently made by the Technocracy. It is equipped with special circuitry, somehow resonating with the Shadowtech. This system, however unreliable, threatens our crucial advantage in stealth. Ship's exceptionally agile & decently armored. (Acc +40, Dodge +40, Armor 5)."
  STR_VESSEL_HARBINGER_OF_DOOM_UFOPEDIA: "These huge demonic creatures float across the skies of strange Dimensions. In their bellies they hold a cargo of lesser demons. Harbingers have horrific powers: they can shoot blasts of mental energy, surround themselves with Shields, cause supernatural fear, and, most disturbingly, are capable of crossing between Dimensions.{NEWLINE}SHIELDS: 600 (Reg x2)"
  STR_VESSEL_PROBE_UFOPEDIA: "The Empire launches these shiny things to investigate strange activity sites. Following 'em to their target takes some patience, but who knows what ADVENTURE awaits us where they're heading?"
  STR_VESSEL_FOOT_PATROL_UFOPEDIA: "These bandits (Ratmen or otherwise), if they wander too close to our Hideouts, might either attack themselves, or sell our whereabouts to other, more dangerous factions. Due to the low speed of these parties, they can rely on word of mouth and visual evidence, rendering Shrouds quite ineffective. Making them scatter requires accurate shooting."
  STR_VESSEL_RUFF_RAIDERS_UFOPEDIA: "Country bandits, aka Ruffians, travel across land in these armored convoys (or their nautical equivalents), looking for trouble. Said trouble can be one of our Hideouts. If they will find it, they will raid it, and in great numbers. Be careful, their armored cars can launch rockets at our craft (but cannot navigate into our Hideout)."
  STR_VESSEL_LIGHT_GUNBOAT_UFOPEDIA: "A cheaper version of a Gunboat, trades advanced guns for some extra crew. The crew, however, is likely to be poorly armed.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 78"
  STR_VESSEL_GUNBOAT_UFOPEDIA: "What passes for a military vessel amongst those less blessed by the Star Gods. A mix between an Escort and a Fighter, worse than either, it carries a well-armed military crew, even if rarely lands.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 111"
  STR_VESSEL_MILITARY_TRANSPORT_UFOPEDIA: "This ship is used by poorer customers (like Spartans, Raiders, Govts) to transport weapons and other military materiel. Don't expect to find anything really extravagant onboard, but still, it makes a fat target.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 78"
  STR_VESSEL_ESCORT_UFOPEDIA: "Least dangerous of military ships, the Escort still is not to be trifled with. It carries a large military crew, armed with modern firearms.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 5; Max DPM: 139"
  STR_VESSEL_GUNSHIP_UFOPEDIA: "This is a small and swift warship that will make short work of your standard pirate vessel. The only chance to seize it is when it lands. Expect numerous crew inside, composed mainly of well-armed, professional soldiers.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 10; Max DPM: 178"
  STR_VESSEL_HEAVY_GUNSHIP_UFOPEDIA: "A trademark Mercenary warship, it is used by other factions as well. Its sight is a sure sign that someone means business, and taking it on either in the air or on the ground would be really hard. The latter is none the less recommended, even though the military crew of this vessel is always armed to the teeth.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 10; Max DPM: 238"
  STR_VESSEL_DESTROYER_UFOPEDIA: "As the name implies, it destroys people. Not as tough or fast as the Cruiser, but more agile and armed with a battery of fast-firing Gat Lascannons.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 15; SHIELDS: 1750 (Reg x1); Max DPM: 350"
  STR_VESSEL_CORVETTE_UFOPEDIA: "Very fast and rather dangerously armed warship, used for hit-and-run tactics. Hence, do not expect it to stay for too long in a fight. Expect it, however, to be swarming with deadly combat crew, as the vessel can be used in Hideout raids. Armed with Gat Lascannons.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 15; Max DPM: 214"
  STR_VESSEL_SOTL_UFOPEDIA: "Armed with multiple heavy plasma cannons and fusion missile launchers, this warship is designed to destroy other warships. Even though our vessels are too small to be accurately targeted by this behemoth, engaging it basically equals suicide.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 30; SHIELDS: 2500 (Reg x1); Max DPM: 700"
  STR_VESSEL_BOMBER_UFOPEDIA: "The Bomber has incredible firepower, even though aerial combat isn't its specialization. Stacked with the fabled Implosion Bombs and protected by heavy armor to ensure their delivery, the Bomber is death incarnate to the poor land-lubbers caught in the warzone.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 10; SHIELDS: 1000 (Reg x1); Max DPM: 404"
  STR_VESSEL_SNAKEBOAT_UFOPEDIA: "This heavy lander is used by Eridian warbands to raid those who have slightly displeased the Star Gods.

  STR_VESSEL_SILVER_TOWERS_UFOPEDIA: "These strange ships are the chariots of Star Gods. Protected by shimmering shields and brimming with arcane energies, they're not an easy foe.{NEWLINE}SHIELDS: 2450 (Reg x9); Dodge 15%; Max DPM: ???"
  STR_VESSEL_COURIER_UFOPEDIA: "The Courier carries a high-level leader of its faction, and that's the most important thing about it. Other than that it's mostly harmless.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 78"
  STR_VESSEL_HOPPER_UFOPEDIA: "This passenger ferry is barely armed and easy to loot. The only problem is, it travels rather fast.{NEWLINE}Caution: only weapons up to 1'6'' in length and 7 pounds in weight are allowed to non-Guild personnel on board.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 36"
  STR_VESSEL_HOTROD_UFOPEDIA: "Only the richest people can afford these beauties. Extremely fast and elusive, but guaranteed to have a highest-rank VIP onboard.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 52"
  STR_VESSEL_EXCAVATOR_UFOPEDIA: "A slow and pretty much unarmed craft used for extraction of minerals, usually by the Traders' Guild.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 56"
  STR_VESSEL_FREIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "This ship is big and tough, but it is still a civilian vessel. A couple of HKs should have no problem with taking it down, especially considering its low speed. The crew is numerous, but rather poorly armed.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 71"
  STR_VESSEL_HEAVY_FREIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "The Traders' Guild uses these ships for heavy lifting on dangerous lines. Not only can they soak up an enormous amount of damage, they also carry huge crews, including a full complement of very well-armed Marsec guards, and a Guild Rep in direct charge.{NEWLINE}SHIELDS: 400 (Reg x1); Max DPM: 104"
  STR_VESSEL_LABSHIP_UFOPEDIA: "These ships are flown by the Academy to spread their information warfare, through jamming, public relations and diplomacy. They should be taken down as fast as possible, otherwise our Infamy will suffer a heavy blow. S.V. is protected by very strong shields, but is quite fragile for something that size.{NEWLINE}SHIELDS: 1500 (Reg x1); Max DPM: 163"
  STR_VESSEL_RAIDER_UFOPEDIA: "Raider Barques are small, general purpose ships that are put together from old hulls and assorted junk. They are poorly armed, poorly armored and poorly managed, but they have large crews for their size.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 86"
  STR_VESSEL_RAIDER_FIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "A small but pretty tough and fast ship used by raiders to scout areas for looting and knock out their air defenses.{NEWLINE}Dodge 20%; Max DPM: 100"
  STR_VESSEL_RAIDER_GUNSHIP_UFOPEDIA: "These vessels, used by infamous Raider leaders, are almost as dangerous as military gunships.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 5; Max DPM: 155"
  STR_VESSEL_REBEL_FREIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "Do not confuse these with Raider ships, which is easy due to the same derelict look. These vessels are used by Mutant Alliance traders and local entrepreneurs, sometimes linked to Provincial Govts. Shooting them down will incur a huge political penalty.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 65"
  STR_VESSEL_SENTRY_UFOPEDIA: "A reconnaissance ship, fast and equipped with an expensive scanning suite. It can spot our Hideout more easily than normal and can be employed to do so.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 91"
  STR_VESSEL_FIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "Don't let the size fool you, they're deadly, crewed by 2-4 elite soldiers and can pull their weight in a fight. Still, with two engines, they make a tempting catch.{NEWLINE}Dodge 20%; Max DPM: 200"
  STR_VESSEL_FIGHTER_G_UFOPEDIA: "This type of Fighter is flown by the Govts, our most esteemed 'benefactor'. Shooting down any ships bearing blue and red lights will cost us a fair amount of points and can lead to a decrease in Protection payments. No lights = fair game, however, killing Govt people will always result in large point penalties.{NEWLINE}Dodge 20%; Max DPM (Damage Per Minute): 200"
  STR_VESSEL_VIPER_FIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "The Viper is Marsec's mainstay space fighter, superior in every way to the fighters we encountered so far. It is equipped with Implosion Bombs which means we better take it down fast, before it does something horrible.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 10; SHIELDS: 500 (Reg x3){NEWLINE}Dodge 30%; Max DPM: 253"
  STR_VESSEL_GOVSHIP_UFOPEDIA: "These large and fancy, if not exactly top-notch vessels are exclusively used by the Govts whenever there is some important business to attend. Looting an Ordinator is tempting (it contains multiple Life Support modules), but it'd cost us a large hit in political relations.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 5; Max DPM: 109"
  STR_VESSEL_GOVT_CRUISER_UFOPEDIA: "The marriage of strange Reticulan tech with the industrial capacities of local govts led to the quiet emergence of this dangerous beast. It needs little outwordly resources, most importantly no Hellerium, as the power is provided by a Reticulan-made Fusion Reactor. We really should avoid shooting at them - it will make our emboldened 'sponsors' very angry."
  STR_VESSEL_MESSENGER_UFOPEDIA: "These ships are the smallest the Star Gods 'grace' with their presence. Despite their small size, they're quite dangerous... not as dangerous as their occupants, though.{NEWLINE}SHIELDS: 400 (Reg x1); Max DPM: 122"
  STR_VESSEL_FRIGATE_UFOPEDIA: "The Frigate is extremely tough and armed with rapid-firing weapons. Its crew is numerous and very well armed.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 10; SHIELDS: 1250 (Reg x1);  Max DPM: 295"
  STR_VESSEL_BOARDING_TORPEDO_UFOPEDIA: "These brutal contraptions are used in space combat, launched against capital ships with extreme velocity, the boarding parties protected from impact by gravity generators. Can be used to breach our Hideouts as well, thankfully their velocity in atmosphere is low enough for our point defenses to react - if we have any, that is."
  STR_VESSEL_BREAKER_UFOPEDIA: "Unarmed but really fast, this stealthy vessel is used to board larger vessels and facilities, while carrying a disproportionately large boarding party. Heavy armor allows it to penetrate some defenses even if it's detected. Serious means are needed to thwart these ships if they're used against us."
  STR_VESSEL_ASSAULT_TRANSPORT_UFOPEDIA: "This is a fast heavy-duty troop transport, used for both space warfare and rapid ground insertion. We can expect these to be used against our Hideouts."
  STR_SYNTH_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA: "This beautiful doll is the most advanced... machine? we have ever seen, Cap'n. It is quasi-biological, as it has all the squiggly stuff we have, but it is heavily reinforced with unknown metal on cellular level. It is a robot with synthetic flesh and blood rather than mechanical body parts (except below her knees). All we understand about this cyber-babe is that she is extremely pretty, but also likely to be very resilient when turned on, so to speak."

  STR_GUILD_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "General Operators are responsible for doing all mundane tasks that need to be done on a Guild's ship, like maintenance, cleaning and minor administrative duties. They are in fact poorly armed civilians who are unlikely to give us trouble, but I have to admit that they're loyal to their employers. It must be greed, Cap'n, because I can't see why anyone would be loyal to the Guild because of their great moral qualities."
  STR_GUILD_TEAM_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "These 'lords amongst men' and 'eyes of the Guild' exist to order minor Guild personnel around and are paid surprisingly well, maybe to create a position the inferiors will fight to achieve (which, as simple math shows, is impossible for most). Team Leaders are uplifted to their status for unwavering loyalty, and are otherwise too dense to be easily scared. In combat, their reactions are good but their aim is terrible."
  STR_GUILD_MEDIC_UFOPEDIA: "The Academy can't be everywhere with their free care. Most health services are covered by doctors with a Guild license. They perform medical procedures... for a price. Unlike their Academy counterparts, they do not hold any pretense to charity. They're cold, unfeeling and almost unshakeable individuals."
  STR_TRADER_ATTENDANT_UFOPEDIA: "This little lady feels proud and empowered by her relatively-important duties and the weapon training she received and thus will not back down that easily in a gunfight. In reality, she's just another exploited female, as her duties are just various forms of serfdom, from making drinks to cleaning other people's mess to even more degrading tasks - even if none of them leave your hands dirty. At most, a bit sticky. Don't have more regrets shooting these than about any other corporate slaves."
  STR_GUILD_SPACE_TECH_UFOPEDIA: "Employees of space-oriented branches of the Guild, like tranS-Stellar or Solmine. They make do in crappy habitations and live their lives tending to a plethora of machineries found on space ships, space mines and all other space establishments. They're proud to be humanity's pioneers in the space conquest - but is it still pioneering, if you're doing the same thing all over for several generations?"
  STR_GUILD_SHIP_OFFICER_UFOPEDIA: "Officers are elite Guild members, experienced at running starships. They have nerves of steel and can whip their crews into near-blind obedience."
  STR_GUILD_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA: "These individuals are amongst the highest tier of Guild operatives, as their responsibility is immense - to steer starships through the cosmos. They're as effective as they're heartless. They're powerful mages, and their talents are often used to interrogate prisoners."
  STR_GUILD_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: "Day-to-day Guild operations are protected by guys like these. They're little more than armed  civilians, to be honest, but their combat armor might cause some trouble. In comparison with standard Combat Armor, it is less resistant to Piercing, Cutting, Fire and Choking, but more to Laser and especially Chem, as is typical for most Guild units."
  STR_MARSEC_SECURITY_UFOPEDIA: "The Trader Guild's military department, Marsec, is the largest employer of shady blokes like this one. He's not too smart and certainly isn't special forces, but he's still a tough guy who's seen a lot. Such people are paid to protect the cargo and they will. Unsurprisingly, their armor is well-made and able to protect the wearer from almost any projectile weapon, so forget using buckshot or pistols against these guys."
  STR_MARSEC_BODYGUARD_UFOPEDIA: "Bodyguards are elite henchmen, usually charged with supervising lesser security personnel or with protection of some VIP. They are as bad as they look: tough, well-trained, and mean. Their power armor can stop small arms and is impregnable to fire, gas and cold; they often carry sweet weapons too, and have valuable information about various people they fought. I wouldn't like to fight them on a regular basis, even though I think they're sexy."
  STR_TRADER_PILOT_UFOPEDIA: "These dudes in funny-looking uniforms aren't actually that harmless. While nowhere as important as the Engineers, they're trained pilots and technicians, are pretty well paid, and will protect their ship with their lives - after all, losing it is going to make them lifelong debt-slaves to the Guild."
  STR_TRADER_SPACEMAN_UFOPEDIA: "A breed of Guild GOs, unlucky enough to work in space. We can learn about various space-related stuff from them."
  STR_TRADER_EXTERMINATOR_UFOPEDIA: "GOs can advance within the Guild, but it is very hard for them to do so. Those especially mean and rugged sometimes become Pest Control Managers. It's a better paid job, but a dirty one if there ever was; it entails dealing - permanently - with various nasty pests, from hostile fauna and flora to mutants. The Pest Control wear light, chem-resistant, flying suits to get where no one else can and are generally much more dangerous (and enthusiastic) than GOs, but their area of expertise isn't dealing with armed and organized opposition - like us."
  STR_GUILD_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA: "This guy is something more than just a deck maintenance officer, I'm telling you. Trader Engineers are important, expensive specialists, who make Guild's ships and other facilities run as smoothly as possible and are often in somewhat influential positions. They're not really warriors, but they are rich enough to carry good weapons and wear some armor, so beware."
  STR_GUILD_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "This lady ain't no small fish among the Guild, representing an actual VIP in their business. Trader Reps like her are few and only present when they are needed, so don't expect to find one behind every tree. They aren't very dangerous themselves, but they're normally protected by a large security force. Needless to say, we should capture them alive whenever possible, as the Guild will pay a lot for returning them."
  STR_GUILD_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA: "These VIPs are the richest of the rich in the Guild, dealing with all the important stuff like politics and strategical business. Naturally, they are hard to come by, so capturing more of them will be a pain. Moreover, they commonly wear golden powered armors which make their bodyguards look like midgets with pointy sticks - not only hard to break, but protected against magic! Still, they hold critical information on the Guild's activity, and we can sell them back with enormous profit, so let's try to catch them all!"
  STR_MARSEC_MARINE_UFOPEDIA: "The Colonial Marines are Marsec's frontline soldiers, used in all manner of space and planetary operations. They're highly trained, cyborgized and pumped full of combat drugs, which gives them superhuman performance. Marsec has perfected the Stellar Empire's technology over the centuries, and Marines armor, while light, is very tough and protected by advanced energy shields. The presence of Colonial Marines on Earth is not what the Star Gods would fully approve of, and it means a major escalation."
  STR_OSIRON_LAD_UFOPEDIA: "These junior members of Osiron seem to be servants to the Academy, doing all kinds of menial work the academicians hate so much, but this picture might fool you. In actuality, the Osiron Yeomen think very little of the Academy, their duty being sworn to Osiron leaders instead. It's some sort of rite of passage they have to complete before being allowed to advance in the Osiron structure. Curiously enough, they show combat capabilities much above that of the Osiron Security cohorts, especially in melee, speed and Evasion. It seems Osiron is quite unwilling to share its best with the Academy."
  STR_ACADEMY_STUDENT_UFOPEDIA: "The Academy recruits mainly from tribes and villages, even though it is normally associated with human cityfolk. These young women are given clean, snazzy clothes to appreciate their new position and enough work and study to make them stop thinking about any life they had before the Academy took it. Seems that the lower your rank is in the Academy, the more work you need to do, since Students are used for virtually everything, from running endless errands to manning dangerous posts. They're too weak and unskilled for serious labour, though, so we can only enslave them."
  STR_ACADEMY_NURSE_UFOPEDIA: "Nurses are beastmasters/healers/guards who help Academy teams during their humanitarian aid missions. They're trained to aggressively assume authority over bands of confused tribals, provide first aid and manhandle any mutant who refuses to be taken to Academy's hospital for healing and further screening. Nurses carry little of value, except for their pedantically cleaned clothing, which can be torn to get bandages."
  STR_SECTOID_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA: "Also called 'The Owls', they are armed people who accompany Academicians on away missions to protect them from things like us. Their combat prowess is rather poor, especially initiative - probably because of all the classes on wars and tactics they were forced to endure - but they get good weapons and carapace armor. Seems that they have somehow fallen from grace in Osiron and got relegated to such tasks. If you see them in battle, be careful as they can target people spotted by Drones or leaders."
  STR_SECTOID_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "They're low-level helpers, carrying out surveys and minor investigations for the Academy, writing analyses and doing most of the actual Academy's work in general. They call themselves 'researchers', but many of them are more like tribals with above average wits and some fancy equipment. They rarely carry good weapons, but remember that they're tougher and more savvy than they may seem at first."
  STR_SECTOID_EXPLORER_UFOPEDIA: "Explorer status is granted to members of the Academy who are exceptional enough to be given a chance of advancement into their elite: Medics, Engineers or even Espers. To test their mettle and weed out the weak, the Explorers are sent on dangerous missions, but they're also trusted with more expensive equipment, like their iconic hazmat suits."
  STR_SECTOID_MEDIC_UFOPEDIA: "Academician Medics are responsible for biological surveys, as well as providing medical services to poor people when they need more recruits. They are also known to experiment on humans and perhaps even kittens. They often carry pneumatic rifles with tranquilizing darts to catch some perfect specimens like us, so remember to keep your buttocks covered when one of them is roaming around! As for our gains, Medics' knowledge about mutants will be invaluable when searching for allies."
  STR_SECTOID_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA: "Engineers are common among the Academicians, as they're needed to maintain their ships, labs and other extravaganza. They are just normal peepz in light armors, but they are clever and experienced. Sometimes I wish we could keep them around for longer, but obviously we can't trust them with our tools."
  STR_ACADEMY_SCIENTIST_UFOPEDIA: "Scientists are the top amongst Academicians who graduate in technology. They wear fancy power armor, light but protected by energy shields, and have a knack for constructing and using weird gizmos and bizarre weapons. Academy Scientists are both socially privileged and not quite right in their minds, the combined effects of which give them really good morale and general smugness."
  STR_ACADEMY_COUNSELLOR_UFOPEDIA: "Counsellors are the top medics amongst the Academy. However, they do not practice medical arts as much as they hone their minds and bodies. They move quickly and gracefully in their skin-tight jumpsuits (and not even any underwear to constrict them); they also enjoy the authority to enter any place. Thus they're liberated in both the literal and metaphorical sense. They employ powerful magics that attack the Charm resistance, making them master negotiators. They're also very hard to break, as they can control pain."
  STR_SECTOID_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "So called 'espers' are mages of the Academy, able to do scary things like reading people's minds or paralyzing them with fear. Many of them are actually quite powerful and they consider themselves higher beings from us mortals, though they don't have the boobs to liken themselves to Star Gods. I'm sure we could sell this one for a nice pile of cash, but only after extracting all the information we can. Nevertheless, I'm not happy to have them in our hideout, not at all."
  STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA: "Provosts are capi di tutti capi in the Academy, the only ones to speak to Star Gods personally. They are chosen from among the Espers to lead them and are therefore extremely dangerous. Needless to say, they are very rare, well protected and possess terrible magical powers. Which doesn't mean we'll stop trying to capture more of them!"
  STR_ACADEMY_THRALL_UFOPEDIA: "These men have been turned into playthings by Academy Counsellors. Apart from being used in the obvious way, they also act as guardians. Their constant diet of drugs and hormons makes them nearly zombie-like: resistant to pain, almost oblivious to the sense of danger, and physically imposing. We think we can switch their loyalties to have equally useful servants, but this can take some work..."
  STR_CHURCH_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "These Neophytes are mostly recruited from among the poor and forsaken, baited by the Reverends with promises of a better life. Then they get a nasty VooDoo treatment, which reinforces their warm feelings towards The Church and, by extension, Star Gods. Neophytes are still on a level of street urchins, but the Church is rich and provides them with good weapons."
  STR_CHURCH_BOY_UFOPEDIA: "These very young men dutifully serve the Church's priesthood in all areas where being an adult is not a requirement. It is a bit regretful (and hurtful to our reputation) if we're forced to kill them, but maybe we don't have to, as they have no chance against our special skills, if you know what I mean, Cap'n. If all else fails, a stun baton would do as well."
  STR_CHURCH_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA: "This is what you get when you overdose a Neophyte with propaganda and other drugs: a Zealot. Zealots believe themselves to be directly controlled by the will of the Star Gods and, somehow, this makes them almost completely fearless. Despite their resolve and their fancy armor, they aren't as well-trained as professional soldiers, but they're fast and often compensate for their lack of accuracy by using the Church's trademark weapon: flamethrowers!"
  STR_CHURCH_HANDMAID_UFOPEDIA: "The clergy would never tarnish their reputation by hiring servants off the street. The Shrine Maidens, while doing basically the same tasks, are well-paid and protected by their sacred status. They're skilled handmaids, performers and courtesans who, as the clergy says, can add a piece of celestial purity into even the dirtiest of mundane works."
  STR_CHURCH_MAIDEN_UFOPEDIA: "The Church has an all-female order tasked with defense, called Maidens of War. Unlike Zealots, they're rarely used in offensive actions. Their origins are also different - unlike street urchins and assorted riffraff, the Maidens are recruited from the children of the Church's low level workers and Church-run orphanages. Maidens' training is centered on martial arts, but they seem to be pretty well educated in general. What we have caught is a low-level Maiden, and she seems to be more susceptible to our subtle coercion than many of the other, fanatical members of the Church.{NEWLINE}The armor Maidens wear is a customized version of a standard human Combat Armor, slightly more resistant to energy, but less to chem and piercing than normal, which seems to be a staple of all Church armors."
  STR_CHURCH_ELITE_UFOPEDIA: "It is unbelievable that a human, even aided with a fancy refractor-equipped flying armor, can achieve such levels of physical performance. The Exalts not only can sustain enormous amounts of poison, exertion, pain or humiliation, they seem to actually enjoy it. These elite fighters also seem to be less block-headed than normal Zealots; they don't really revere the Star Gods at all. If anything, they narcissistically revere themselves. Seems that the inner circles of the Church are more into debauchery and self-indulgence than praying."
  STR_BEASTMASTER_TERRORIST_UFOPEDIA: "Beastmasters are a special caste within The Church who tends to its critters. If you've seen those pets, you must have an idea on what their masters are like. They are smart, physically strong, daring and often a little wrong in the heads. Do not relax once you destroy their armor - the arcane circuitry on their underwear still dissipates laser energies very well and can even be used to deliver low-powered laser blasts. Better take them from behind, nay?"
  STR_CHURCH_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA: "The heavy armor of a Beastmaster shares the same base characteristics as Zealot's armor, although it is thicker, well-shielded and provides full enviro protection (fire & gas) - Beastmasters are much more valuable and usually leave attacking to their pets, so mobility is not required. The defining (and expensive) feature of this armor is its ablativeness - if the damage is too great to withstand, it explodes outwards, revealing a pretty much unharmed and very pissed Beastmaster."
  STR_CHURCH_MATRON_UFOPEDIA: "Matrons are universally revered and respected officials and leaders within the Maidens of War order of the Church. Their duties are to run Maiden covens, but also various non-military establishments of the Church, from food handout centres to hospitals. Sometimes they also serve as special envoys for the Church. They're skilled melee fighters, diplomats, lore-keepers and healers. In short, these older women are jaded, sophisticated and kind of creepy so we'd better keep them separated from the rest of our population, who knows what kind of curses and love-magics they possess?"
  STR_CHURCH_PRIEST_UFOPEDIA: "Priests are the Church's field operatives, often not very bright but always fanatical in their fervour and true to their belief. The Church naturally assumes that everyone worships Star Gods, which is sometimes a good thing, and sometimes a very bad thing. Be careful, them priests know how to brawl. They are usually former Zealots and might tell us about their trade as well."
  STR_CHURCH_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "Reverends are lower level spiritual leaders, who have the right to claim that they speak the will of the Star Gods. More refined and richer than ordinary Zealots, they are nevertheless as fanatical and can pose a significant threat. With plenty of foolhardy people and magical powers at their disposal, these make bad enemies. They also have nice refractors, but are otherwise rather easy to take down in close quarters combat. What's curious: they seem to be also interested in the ways of the Old Earth, which seems to be a contradiction to their Star Gods worship..."
  STR_CHURCH_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA: "These high leaders of The Church are powerful, clever and highly skilled in magics. Commanding entire armies of fanatical warriors, each one of these is worth a fortune, if we manage to capture them. Just look at these robes! Surprisingly however, these hedonistic individuals do not seem to take the Star God worship as seriously as one would expect - like the Star Gods were only convenient idols for them, and fully replaceable."
  STR_APOC_DISCIPLE_UFOPEDIA: "The Disciples might appear like cult leaders, but it is not strictly true; the cult is actually anarchistic in nature and we have learned nothing about any possible high leadership. It is only known that many temples exist, loosely connected by flow of cultists and supplies. In part this is because of secrecy, in part because the cultists do not care much about investigating or understanding. Their eyes have already been opened and they need to know nothing besides the way of the Apocalypse. The Disciples worship all aspects of Apocalypse equally; what sets them apart is their savviness with words, used to convert beggars and kings alike."
  STR_APOC_SADIST_UFOPEDIA: "These guys have joined the Cult of Apocalypse for the sheer love of hurting others. They believe the world should be drowned in the screams of the tormented. Sadists are usually seen as footsoldiers of the Apocalypse, they're strong and tough, but their hoods do somewhat impede their reactions."
  STR_APOC_MARAUDER_UFOPEDIA: "One of the common 'ways of the Apocalypse', undertook by its believers, is to join the 'Legion of Chernobog' and become a faceless warrior, one of many, indifferent to their own death as long as Apocalypse is being raised. In place of their faces, Marauders are granted occular implants so no enemy can escape their sight. They also carry hidden blades."
  STR_MUTON_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "The Mercenaries are tenacious, lethal and very tough. They do not negotiate with their enemies, so don't expect to get much ransom for their warriors. Even these lower-ranking Mercs are not an enemy to be trifled with, as the companies always recruit new members from mutants with combat experience."
  STR_MUTON_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA: "The Commandos are combat veterans of ill-renown, who wear the toughest muscle-suits, equipped with gravpacks for maximum mobility. Do not even think these guys are going to go down without a serious fight."
  STR_MUTON_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA: "The so-called Engineers are a special caste within mercenary companies. Of course, they're fully capable engineers, tending to mercenary ships and weapons. However, in combat, they're far from being pushovers: their custom weapons, camo suits and combat sights make them extremely deadly marksmen. They're also able to see through stealth, spotting your camouflaged units from far away."
  STR_MUTON_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA: "Some of the Mercs, who are too crazy or stupid to be trusted with ranged weapons, wear massive suits of Plastasteel armor and serve as living battering rams, armed with lethal plasma gloves that can destroy pretty much anything in a super-gory fashion. The best practical way of killing them, short of a tactical nuke, is a powerful laser blast to their comparatively thin back plate."
  STR_MUTON_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "The Mercenary Captains are the elite within an elite; they dedicate their whole lives to mastering all aspects of the art of warfare, from sword fighting through squad tactics to orbital bombardments. While engaging rank-and-file Mercenaries with melee weapons is a viable, if desperate tactic; against these guys, it is strongly unadvised. The Mercenary Captains are also ranking members of the so-called 'Space Rangers', thus linking these two forces together in the Stellar Empire's enforcers' hierarchy."
  STR_MUTON_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA: "The toughest and strongest of all Mercenaries, veterans of countless battles and figures of considerable power. They fight with fluidity and speed backed by decades of practice and honed by combat drugs."
  STR_GOVT_AGENT_UFOPEDIA: "Instead of relying on slaves to do general tasks, the Govts deploy these well-motivated individuals. Don't let their looks deceive you, these guys have quick reflexes, know how to use their guns and won't break down easily. They are also trained in martial arts, so don't be surprised if they dodge your melee attacks."
  STR_GOVT_PILOT_UFOPEDIA: "Since being allowed to fly a nuclear-powered vessel is considered a major privilege in any Provincial Govt's organization, these guys consider themselves to be elite. Truth be told, despite their buffoonery, they're usually much better specialists than Guild Air Sailors. Watch out for their well-honed reflexes if you actually engage them in ground combat - which is a sure way to offend their masters and upset our politics, by the way."
  STR_GOVT_MP_UFOPEDIA: "Military Police are pretty much the only kind of police most people will ever see. Armed with heavy weapons and riding armored vehicles, or even aircraft, these hard-like-rock men will usually shoot first, ask questions later. None the less, they're govt officers, even if much less valuable than Enforcers or Pilots, so getting in a shootout with them is a political decision."
  STR_GOVT_ENFORCER_UFOPEDIA: "The government Enforcers are what the name implies - people who kill people whom the Provincial Govts deem necessary to be killed. They might lack the sheer survival instincts of the Marsec security men, but they're very well trained, are better shots and have stronger minds. They wear the same standard carapace armor as most security forces."
  STR_GOVT_ELITE_UFOPEDIA: "These guys are the Govt's special forces, rigorously trained and highly loyal to their employers. They wear improved personal armor (equipped with simple active camouflage - CAMO: 15/5, and great ThV - 70%), are issued better weapons, and can boast high combat skills, almost on par with veteran Mercenaries."
  STR_GOVT_SIREN_UFOPEDIA: "As the Govts started to seriously consider cooperating with Reticulans to create a common earth-dweller front, they wanted to co-opt Reticulan psionics too. However, they had no trust in Hybrids, and the Rets themselves were willing to share only Sirens and Sectogres. Since Sirens were smarter and sexier, while equally obedient, the govts chose them. The Govt Siren is psionically-boosted, which makes her a dangerous mind-controller, and military training ensures her standard combat skills are adequate as well. Their light armor is especially good against Piercing damage."
  STR_GOVT_GENERAL_UFOPEDIA: "Highest-ranking Provincial Govt commanders are worth a royal ransom. Hopefully worth enough to compensate for the huge trouble we've brought on ourselves for attacking one of them."
  STR_BANDIT_RATMAN_UFOPEDIA: "The Ratmen are a sub-race of mutant midgets, universally despised by everyone, in no small part for their disregard of private property. For that reason, they face a choice between embracing robbery or dying alone, which is a very simple choice indeed. They're weak and fragile, but do not underestimate their reflexes and shooting abilities."
  STR_REAPER_CAVALRY_TERRORIST_UFOPEDIA: "Reapers are fairly common in some communities as farm animals, for their durability, strength and produce. These ratmen use them as mounts."
  STR_BANDIT_RATMAN_HUNTER_UFOPEDIA: "These ratmen wander the outskirts of their 'villages' as well as more civilized settlements, hunting for prey, be it unwary travellers or wild animals, anything goes to feed their destitute communities. They're a bit better fighters than average Ratlings, especially with the bow and the knife. They're the most dangerous when met at night, when they can take advantage of their innate night vision (all Ratlings have a NV of 15), while they themselves are hard to spot (CAMO: 4)."
  STR_BANDIT_RATMAN_STORMRAT_UFOPEDIA:  "The Stormrats, or SMATs, are elite Ratmen enforcers, trained to storm houses with overwhelming force. Usually they do this to people who have slighted or offended the Ratmen Mafia in some way, like by refusing to pay racket or to honor the Mafia properly. Sometimes, however, SMATs storm houses of random people just to stay sharp. They wear armor that is annoyingly resistant to standard firearms, especially from the front, not giving any chance to shotgun-wielding farmers."
  STR_BANDIT_RATMAN_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "These Ratmen are even more skilled rogues than usual, always quick to use their knives, but that's not what makes them really dangerous. They are high-ranking enforcers and racket collectors, working for the bosses of the Ratmen Mafia, and killing them might cause reprisals - the Mafia is known for its vengefulness and territoriality."
  STR_BANDIT_BOY_UFOPEDIA: "Gangs that operate in cities always need a fresh stock of footsoldiers, and these young guys fit the bill perfectly - some crack, booze and hoes keep their loyalty, while losing one is not a biggie. They're quite ruthless, but relatively easy to scare or impress. Their combat abilities aren't completely mediocre, and they possess some skill at dodging fist and knife attacks."
  STR_BANDIT_HIGHWAYMAN_UFOPEDIA: "The Highwaymen are seasoned and well-trained plunderers, who also often work as bodyguards, bounty hunters or lawmen. They're romanticized in popular culture, but not liked by the federal govts. They prefer to use ranged weapons, and possess better training with those than most Bandits, but they're far from harmless in melee. Their leather armors allow them to dodge sloppy blows, as well as provide some protection against most forms of attack, like daze, fire, chem, smoke and cutting - at the price of movement speed."
  STR_BANDIT_DRIFTER_UFOPEDIA: "Drifters are nondescript individuals in a perpetual transitory state, often travelling from town to another town in search for who knows what. Dextrous with gun and knife, they don't turn down dirty work. Their nomadic and loner nature often leads them to developing strong spirituality, or, as others call it, going cuckoo. It's not a rare occurrence when a Drifter joins some crazy cult or develops taste for sentient flesh; on the other hand, some stabilize enough to join city militias."
  STR_BANDIT_RUFFIAN_UFOPEDIA: "They say that ruffians are more numerous than wild animals these days. You can find these guys in every part of the world, getting themselves busy with other people's possessions. They might be just lowly criminals, but times are hard, and they have to be hard as well to survive, so they should not be underestimated. They prefer the countryside to the busy and unhealthy cities."
  STR_BANDIT_TROUBLEMAKER_UFOPEDIA: "These teenagers join bandits to escape the bleakness of their villages, get some thrills and hang out with cool guys. They carry out support roles and do not present much threat in combat. They're quite brave due to their dumbness, though."
  STR_BANDIT_DUDE_UFOPEDIA: "Rank and file bandits, often employed by various mobs as soldiers. Some others work as bouncers, yet others as slavers. They're most abundant in cities. Unlike poorer bandits, they wear some cheap armor, which gives them slight resistance to Piercing, Cutting and Chem damage - shotgun pellets, small bore bullets and knives are all part of their daily life. They have no special skills or weaknesses, except for being, on average, not very sharp."
  STR_BANDIT_FUSSBALLER_UFOPEDIA: "These strapping young lads are known for their boldness, hence, probably, the term. They are adventuring types, working for town gangs or forming gangs on their own. In these endeavours, they are of the mind that poor guns cannot defeat skillful tackles and headbutts. As such, they're equipped with close combat gear and called upon when a vicious mugging is in order. Many dream of becoming Gravball celebrities."
  STR_BANDIT_HITMAN_UFOPEDIA: "A specialist in dirty work. Tougher and more tenacious than he looks. Skilled at spotting camouflaged units. Watch out for his high reflexes and accuracy."
  STR_BANDIT_BOSS_UFOPEDIA: "Bandit communities are usually ruled by the strong, not necessarily smart. These Brutes however possess enough charisma and animal cunning to either rule by themselves, and if not, they employ brainy advisors - or extra muscle. Sometimes, a Bandit Boss is only a figurehead, with the real controller pulling the strings from behind. The susceptibility of Brutes to magical charms is a well known fact..."
  STR_BANDIT_TOMB_RUNNER_UFOPEDIA: "There are many old ruins in the world, underground or otherwise, and these valued specialists are professional looters. In this line of work, requiring climbing, rappelling and running from monsters, armor is usually a hindrance, but Runners wear some protection against melee and chem. They're also in top physical form and trained in stealth and defense against dark magics. Their fancy and expensive equipment grants them NV of 12. Our sponsors consider Tomb Runners to be pests and won't be upset if we dispose of them, just like of any other bandits."
  STR_BANDIT_GHOUL_UFOPEDIA: "These despicable creatures suffer from the horrible Necron disease. The full enviro suits they wear protect both themselves from their surroundings, and vice versa. They sometimes conduct 'harvest' raids to replace their failing organs with fresh ones, taken from their victims. They live in small communities, known for their medical and chemical knowledge. The disease they suffer from, apart from disfiguration, decay and horrible smell, also gives them some unique feats - like the ability to regenerate lost health during battle, at the cost of a major strain to their bodies. They're immune to chem and smoke, and resistant to daze, laser and concussion. Their sole weakness is Burn damage, but when they stop burning, they just regenerate back. They see through smoke quite well (ThV: 50%). Better to kill them fast to avoid trouble."
  STR_BANDIT_GHOUL_SCI_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Scientists' are the leaders and shamans of the Ghoul communities, very skilled in medicine, genetics and even engineering. Feeling nothing but envy and contempt for all 'Smoothies', as the Necron-inflicted call us, they indulge in the most abhorrent experiments. They're also faster, more perceptive and tougher than their rank-and-file Ghoul brethren."
  STR_JUNGLE_GAL_UFOPEDIA: "These jungle-dwellers are an example of what happens with Ubers who try to live in the wild. They eat Zombies to gain Zombie-like endurance and prolong their lives - which has, apparently, worked, at the price of making them completely mad. When we started to interrogate one, she seemed to be very attracted to the Brainers, but the untowardly attraction turned out to be more untowardly than we thought - they don't seem to be opposed to the idea of having a fellow Uber as a side dish. These savages seem to have links to some sort of 'zombie masters', whoever they might be."
  STR_NECROPIRATE_UFOPEDIA: "These guys apparently had the same idea as us, to become pirates. Desiring to strengthen their bodies, they gave in to practice of consuming 'zombie flesh'. While they succeeded in gaining great resilience, it ultimately caused degeneration. Now they're desperate for every morsel of hellerium-tainted flesh, zombie or otherwise. At least that much we can divine from their barely articulate ramblings. Let it be a lesson to us, because, really, they're useless for anything else."
  STR_BLOOD_DOG_UFOPEDIA: "These vicious, mutated animals are often employed by Bandits for combat. It is unclear how the Bandits are able to tame such creatures, but judging by how these small monsters look, maybe it's just a case of misery loving company. The Hounds are adept at surviving on the wastelands and are somewhat resistant to all forms of damage; piercing and concussive weapons seem to work best against them, while smoke, daze and fire are the least effective. The huge, thick skull of the creature serves both as a support for its powerful jaws and as natural armor, so better engage them from the sides or behind."
  STR_GHOUL_EXPERIMENTS: "Ghoul Experiments"
  STR_GHOUL_EXPERIMENTS_UFOPEDIA: "The Ghouls are obsessed with prolonging their life through regeneration, while retaining their Necron disease. It allows them superhuman resilience, and is important to their culture. They abduct young specimens and treat them to any imaginable abuse, to test various regenerative solutions. To finance their scientific pursuits, they provide organ transplants to Academicians who start developing resistance to the Stellar Empire's Longevity Serum, or cannot afford it at all. The organs are viciously harvested from Ghoul captives. We've gained some new inroads into the Academy's organization, while Ghoul medical data can be useful to our own research."
  STR_DOGG_UFOPEDIA: "A small beast of Earth origin, used in hunting, warfare and agriculture since ancient times. Despite all kinds of alien and mutated creatures available for the task, the Dogs are still tamed and bred by humans and mutants alike, for their fierce loyalty and ease of training. (Animal Lover Award: 200 points granted)"
  STR_GIANT_RAT_UFOPEDIA: "These mutated rodents have a famous talent for survival, intricate social structure and very sharp teeth (Cutting damage, damages armor). CAMO: 13/3. NV: 16. SPOT: 5. SENSE: 10 (smell)"
  STR_GIANT_BEETLE_UFOPEDIA: "These large, mutated insects have proven to be indestructible as a species, and only got better over the last few centuries. Very hard to kill unless with fire or poisonous gas. Omnivorous, they attack with mandibles coated with saliva that dissolves most forms of matter (Chem damage, damages armor). NV: 10. ThV: 40%. CAMO: 16/4."
  STR_MEGASCORPION_UFOPEDIA: "These beasties employ a large sting to poison their victims (Bio, halves armor). Said stings are very sought after for their supposed benefits to male sexual prowess; after being ground, the stings are either consumed or applied directly to the body part in question. Creature's armor can sometimes deflect Piercing and Laser attacks due to being well-angled. SENSE: 15 (tremors). CAMO: 10/2."
  STR_MEGASCORPION_POISON_UFOPEDIA: "This fluid can only be extracted from a freshly-killed creature, as it rapidly deteriorates when in contact with fresh air. It can be sold for some good coin or kept for later in a tightly-closed flask. The poison is quite dangerous as it not only causes Health loss, but also rapidly drains Energy."
  STR_GIANTSPIDER_UFOPEDIA: "Giant spiders are fast, tenacious and very poisonous (Bio damage). SENSE: 15 (tremors). CAMO: 12/4."
  STR_CHUPACABRA_UFOPEDIA: "Very fast, very aggressive and equipped with very sharp teeth (Cutting damage). ThV: 50%. CAMO: 13/1."
  STR_VAMPIRE_BAT_UFOPEDIA: "A mythical beast that moves fast and stealthily. It is almost impossible to evade its senses or react in time once it swoops down. Its only weaknesses are a fragile frame and poor day sight. Its bite isn't instantly lethal, but drains a lot of Energy and Stun, as well as regenerates creature's health (Cutting damage). NV/DV: 25. ThV: 100%. SPOT: 15. CAMO: 0/7"
  STR_RYBA_UFOPEDIA: "These fish can bite you if you come too close, but overall they're not too dangerous (Cutting damage). SENSE: 15 (water)."
  STR_KRAB_UFOPEDIA: "This species of crab is very territorial and infamous for cutting bikini strings. We theorize it is instinct to remove the shell of its prey before starting to eat; while not very powerful, its attacks will incur serious armor damage (Cutting damage). SENSE: 15 (tremors)."
  STR_HALLUCINOID_UFOPEDIA: "These giant brain-jellyfish-tentacle-monsters appear as if taken right out of a psychoactive-drug induced dream. Only they're psychoactive themselves and pretty much real. The hallucinations they conjure can make our crew panic or even attack their mates, perceiving them as monsters. When up close, Hallucinoids are prone to attack with tentacles from which not even armor can fully protect. Pleasurable as it might seem, it is also potentially deadly (Bio damage). SENSE: 40."
  STR_HALLUCINOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Hallucinoid Examination. SENSE: 40."
  STR_RAIDER_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: "The Scouts are at the bottom of the Raider's food chain, and always end up with the worst guns. Still, despite their crappy gear, they're Ubers like us, which makes them fast and tough."
  STR_RAIDER_THUG_UFOPEDIA: "In the Raider's world, might makes right, and so the Thugs are above the Scouts through the sheer physical might they possess, hence they end up with better guns. However, they're not as fast. Generally, they're just Very Tough Guys, nothing more."
  STR_RAIDER_BUZZARD_UFOPEDIA: "Buzzards are rich enough to get their hands on grav-packs and other high-tech gear, including combat drugs they indulge in without any restraint. Whatever can be said about their sanity (which is not much), the drugs make them quick and deadly."
  STR_RAIDER_BOSS_UFOPEDIA: "The strongest, toughest and smartest (the latter being an easy feat) Raiders become Bosses of their gangs. Their trademark spikey breastplates aren't actually that good at stopping bullets, while considerably slowing the wearers down, but Bosses shouldn't be underestimated, as they have access to the best weapons a gang possesses. This gives them knowledge about guns, and I think they'd be willing to share if asked nicely."
  STR_RAIDER_HUMONGOUS_UFOPEDIA: "Sometimes Raider parties contain these brutes, who are even harder to put down than ordinary Raiders. They have the physical capacity to lead their own gangs, but rarely have the smarts required (most, indeed, have the mental faculties of an average monkey); and those few who do, usually proceed to join the Mercenaries."
  STR_RAIDER_FIREBAT_UFOPEDIA: "Large gangs of Raiders are sometimes led by these pyromaniacs, clad in scavenged suits of powered armor. Take note that while the armor isn't of the very best quality, it contains a veteran Uber leader. Compared to human powered armor, it is slightly more resilient to fire, plasma, piercing and cutting damage. It does lack equally good sights, though."
  STR_UBER_BELTER_UFOPEDIA: "Belters are a race of Ubers who have been living on space stations and starships for several centuries. They are very highly valued by the Guild for their great technical skills and often hired to maintain large vessels. Belters form a hermetic and strange culture, with their own secret beliefs and rituals. They're, of course, the most well known for not wearing clothes, which is said to be demanded by the kind of artificial Zone ecosystems they employ to survive. They live on specially maintained space habitats - replenishing Hellerium is expensive to them, hence their need to travel to work with the Guild. Space is their home turf, so we shouldn't under-estimate them..."
  STR_APOCALYPSE_CULT_UFOPEDIA: "The world has become corrupt and life is cheap. People are sinful and unrepentant. A great purge is needed. The Cult of Apocalypse works to hasten the inevitable destruction of the world by any means available, believing that abandon and obliteration brings absolution. It is no wonder, then, that this vast and secretive movement is hunted down by every other faction. The Cult has access to dark magics, and all its full-fledged members are basically half-demons: fearless, immune to pain and preternaturally strong. The Cult reveres the Dark Ones, although it doesn't seem to be able to control them in any way."
  STR_SPARTAN_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: "It is very hard for a female to be accepted into the ranks of the Spartan warriors, but the alternative - being a virtual property of a Spartan fort - is so unappealing that many of them try anyway. They rarely advance past the lowest rank, but they're forced to constantly prove they are better than their male peers, so they cannot be underestimated. They can be interrogated for their knowledge of various light firearms."
  STR_SPARTAN_RIFLEMAN_UFOPEDIA: "Riflemen are the rank-and-file Spartans, but that doesn't mean they aren't pretty dangerous (and bad-mouthed). Still, they can be convinced to tell us what they know about firearms."
  STR_SPARTAN_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA: "As in the Spartan world, having a big gun is synonymous with having a big... uhm, respect, these guys are well-respected (even though we found no solid evidence in that area that could be a basis for respecting this group more than any average group of pureblood males - possibly more research would be in order). They are strong enough to easily carry heavy weapons, and can tell us about those."
  STR_SPARTAN_CAPTAIN_UFOPEDIA: "Spartan warbands are led by these low-ranking officers, whose words are to be followed without question. They wear improved Spartan armor, so don't be surprised if they don't go down easily. They're always combat veterans, so their fighting skills are great, and their knowledge can be used to our advantage if we manage to capture more of them. Their cheap night shades give them NV of 12."
  STR_HUMAN_SOLDIER_COMMANDO_UFOPEDIA: "An elite human soldier, found in better-equipped military forces and very rich raiding gangs. Wears a full, bulletproof, chameleonic body suit laced with sophisticated electronics. Watch out for his deadly accuracy. Can be questioned for his broad knowledge of weaponry. Trivia: Human Commandos find the vague term 'Purebloods' as insulting, and identify themselves with the 'humans of old', which seems to be some sort of a loose but large organization (or a network of loosely affiliated organizations), lurking in the shadows. Hence, we can ransom these guys for good coin."
  STR_HUMAN_NOMAD_UFOPEDIA: "These tribesmen embrace strict religion and shun the modern, civilized society and technology. Their tribe is said to be constantly raided by various bandits, who kidnap their women; so the men must constantly sell themselves as hunters and caravan guards to make dough to buy them back. Funny story, that is, but makes sense: nobody likes the lofty Nomads for how they're hell-bent on aggressively ignoring the world outside of their tribe. Combat-wise, they employ camouflaged suits of thick Durathread and are generally far better equipped that one would think."
  STR_MEGAPOL_UFOPEDIA: "Status: GLOBAL POLICE{NEWLINE}Megapol is a global police organization, privately-owned and strongly tied to the Guild. They're authorized to hunt crime all over the planet. The local govts aren't too happy with this, but they have little choice, considering limitations in global travel and the considerable cost of keeping their own, loyal police forces in full capacity. Megapol often helps Govts (or competes with them) to fight all kinds of crime, but its sword is aimed first and foremost against the Black Market. Govts don't love the Black Market, but consider it a necessary evil as it allows them to distribute goods outside the Solar Governor's knowledge and Guild's tariffs. Megapol naturally works for the Guild, Academy and Church as well."
  STR_MEGAPOL_WOLFMAN_UFOPEDIA: "Megapol readily employs Beastmen for policing duties, as the work doesn't require high intelligence and Beastmen are cheap and very receptive to orders. Wolfmen have naturally keen senses, giving them not only NV 12 but also an ability to smell camouflaged units. Their long-range vision at day isn't as keen, though. They're clad in shiny armor that protects quite well against most threats, but is vulnerable to Chem. Their stamina allows them to move quite fast in this armor, but their combat skills, and especially willpower, are as terrible as one would expect of a Beastman. SPOT: 3 (smell)"
  STR_MEGAPOL_ENFORCER_UFOPEDIA: "Pigmen are not only burly, but also quite smart for Beastmen. They're employed as either herders of Wolfmen, or as shock troopers in their own assault units. Swines nowadays can also, apparently, fly; their synthmuscle-powered armor is equipped with a grav engine, and to make matters worse, is also stupidly durable, especially against Piercing damage. The grav units they use, however, are of a cheap variety and suffer from critical weakness to Chem. Enforcers move slowly and have poor NV (9), but are able to sniff through camouflage (SPOT: 4)."
  STR_MEGAPOL_DETECTIVE_UFOPEDIA: "Highly paid and extremely skilled operatives, employed by Megapol to lead manhunts. Sometimes they command whole hordes of Beastmen, but more often they work alone. These guys are often augmented and almost always are heavy drug users, which boosts their already high abilities to uncanny levels. Their armor is a custom human Carapace, not much tougher than normal, but without weakness to Chem. NV: 17, ThV: 30%. CAMO: 10/3."
  STR_MEGAPOL_APEMAN_UFOPEDIA: "These powerful beastmen resemble a cross between human and gorilla. They have similar body plan and physical abilities to Brute mutants, but aren't simply just weak to magic and manipulation - they're critically vulnerable to it. They're also nowhere as skilled with firearms. Megapol makes use of their sheer strength, loyalty and bravery to break up mass gatherings, and their prodigious running skills to tackle suspects. Apemen enjoy some NV (12) but also can see pretty well though smoke (Thermal Vision 50%). They wear Synthmuscle armor that is very resistant to Piercing."
  STR_ETHEREAL_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "This creature, doing tricks with levitation and telekinesis and protected by a strong forcefield turned out to be not really a god, just a muscle-man made in their image. More of a bio-machine than an actual person. Still possesses the SENSE (8)"
  STR_ETHEREAL_NOVICE_UFOPEDIA: "We tried to interrogate that hooded weirdo we've captured, and I'm telling you, it was hard! He almost made the brainers kill one another! And it turns out we succeeded only because we caught one of their youngest, a novice in their order, who eventually succumbed to our diplomatic wiles. But even such a novice commands deadly magics and that's why the Star Gods never use any real weapons. Another lesson is, unless we devise a powerful VooDoo of our own, it's better not to try interrogating more powerful captives."
  STR_ETHEREAL_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "We have finally captured a proper Star God. Turns out their role in the Stellar Empire is that of high-profile messengers and executors, with an absolute authority over all lesser races but subservient to some supreme will; I guess that makes them more like angels than proper gods, but they're really full of themselves anyway. Also it turns out there are several types of Star Gods; the ones we meet are 'Guides', but there are ones called 'Subduers' as well, who don't have that cool glow effect, cannot turn invisible, and are unable to use Ghost Beams, relying on telekinesis and plasma guns instead. The latter type, however, appears mostly during planetary conquests."
  STR_ETHEREAL_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA: "While we suspected the highest-ranking and most powerful Star Gods to be in charge in the Empire, this is not the case. This member of their elite said they're more of an inquisition-like institution, charged with overseeing the empire but never making political decisions; this task belongs to, strange as it may seem, some sort of disembodied super-brains - the true rulers, and usually very autonomous at that (the Star Gods seem to adore them in an almost sexual way). Anyway, the Commander gave us a crucial piece of code required to get to our local super-brain, ruling the Solar System from Mars..."
  STR_MUTANTS_UFOPEDIA: "Status: DOWNDRODDEN MAJORITY{NEWLINE}Earth is inhabited by millions upon millions of mutants, belonging to a bewildering array of strains, tribes and nations. They come in all shapes and sizes, and live everywhere, from forgotten villages to bustling towns; only the strict centres of big cities are forbidden to most of them. While some mutants are downright bizarre, many are indistinguishable from a pureblood human even in a minute examination; most are somewhere in between. One thing is common amongst them: they're treated like dirt by the high and mighty of this world, and are our potential allies. After all, we're mutants too."
  STR_TROLLETARIAT_UFOPEDIA: "One of the major players in the Mutant Alliance. They believe that social class identity is more important than racial identity, seeing that 'Pureblood' is often more of a social status thing than a biological fact. Therefore, all the poor worldwide should get together and forcibly seize property of the rich in a collectivist revolution. 'We All Are Mutants' is their slogan."
  STR_MALE_CIVILIAN_UFOPEDIA: "These are mutants who were influenced by the Uber strain, but in a small enough degree that they can easily survive outside of Zones. They share some Uber characteristics, like tough skin, night vision or strength, but in a less developed form. On the other hand, their resistance to magic is infamously bad, not much better than Beastmen's, which makes them easily swayed by figures of authority. To better resist such influences, many of them adhere to a strange religion, called Monotheism."
  STR_FEMALE_CIVILIAN_UFOPEDIA: "Almost indistinguishable from a human, except for things like strange hair or eye pigmentation or other minor features. They can possess quite unusual agility and magic aptitude, but such individuals quickly rise above the mundane toils of mutant communities, becoming entertainers, clairvoyants or thieves, which brings their whole kind a reputation of being sneaky and untrustworthy."
  STR_CIVILIAN_MUT_3_UFOPEDIA: "Reticulan hybrids who live in normal mutant communities have little in common with their Reticulan ancestors, except for being smart and somewhat immoral. These two qualities make them often rise in social hierarchy, but only to a point; no sane mutant community would choose one to be their leader, and the purebloods loathe them for their alien-ness. Even the Xeno-friendly Church of Sirius offers no refuge to them, as, for unknown reasons, the Church sees the whole Reticulan race as some sort of space traitors. Like all Reticulan strains, they have great nightvision and are hardly impeded by smoke."
  STR_CIVILIAN_MUT_4_UFOPEDIA: "Dumb, strong and bad-tempered, these savages are tolerated by other mutants only because they can be convinced to participate in the hardest manual labour; Lamias have little material needs, but most of them prefer working over hunting to fill their ever-hungry bellies. They're also very resistant to heat and toxin, which is an added advantage, inherited from Snakemen. Lamias have a vicious bite, and some of them can even spit acid."
  STR_CIVILIAN_MUT_5_UFOPEDIA: "Most Brutes, despite being hulking monsters, are quite docile, which makes them popular in any mutant community; they're valued as workers, farmers, and even artisans and leaders. Anything that doesn't require too much science, as they're not gifted in that area, to say the least. Like all Brutes, they're very tough and especially resistant to Daze and Piercing damage."
  STR_HUMANS_UFOPEDIA: "Status: PRIVILEGED MINORITY{NEWLINE}The humans claim they used to rule the Earth. To distinguish themselves from us mutants - most of us look 'humanlike' after all - they call themselves 'Purebloods'. Generally if you can pass for a human, own enough 'legal' property, abide to the law and live in an 'official' settlement, you're a Pureblood. If you're poor or illegal, you're not, even if you look perfectly like a human of old. Humans are aloof, but those who are just simple citizens aren't strictly evil. A just thing to do is to rob and otherwise molest them, while mass-murder is not only morally questionable but might also lead to decreases in our Protection Payments."
  STR_HUMAN_MALE_3_UFOPEDIA: "These bad-mouthed boys will often think that since they own a gun, they're untouchable. Smacking them over their heads, or killing a few others to make an example should destroy that illusion."
  STR_HUMAN_FEMALE_4_UFOPEDIA: "Sturdy clothing and self-confidence mark a woman who's seen her share, knows how to defend herself and usually carries a weapon."
  STR_HUMAN_CITY_GIRL_UFOPEDIA: "These often-not-quite-Purebloods live by all sorts of knavery, from relatively benign information gathering to outright theft. They have quick feet and quick wits, required to survive on the fringes of the Pureblood society. When engaged in melee, they can sometimes dodge blows that'd otherwise hit."
  STR_HUMAN_HOE_UFOPEDIA: "Although reduced to selling their bodies on the streets, these girls aren't sheep and most of them will jump at the first opportunity to change their life. Don't expect them to stand idle as you rob them, either, even though their combat skills are pitiful."
  STR_HUMAN_CLERK_UFOPEDIA: "These Purebloods are employed to fight encroaching chaos and make the bureaucratic machinery of Govts and Guild work, despite the best efforts of their leaders and the constant breaking down of computers."
  STR_HUMAN_SHARP_GUY_UFOPEDIA: "These dudes in fancy suits are pretty rich and can be ransomed for some good dolaro. They're not affiliated with any Faction though so killing them won't really work towards our 'protection' scheme."
  STR_HUMAN_SHARP_GIRL_UFOPEDIA: "These women are Pureblood whitecollar workers of a fairly high rank (which means sizeable ransom). They're fiercely competitive in their jobs, but, strangely, actual fighting generally scares them. I think with how they are fed up with their current occupations, we could try persuading them into trying our way of life for a change."
  STR_HUMAN_MASTER_UFOPEDIA: "The Mages are amongst the top tier of the Pureblood society, although they prefer to be called 'humans of old' or simply 'men'. The Mages are members of old and powerful families and they wield strong VooDoo, devastating against Beastmen and dangerous even to humans and mutants. Their money, allies and influence are a good safeguard against any prosecution they might face from the Academy. They're quite high and mighty because of their status and can be sold for quite a ransom. Mages don't wear any armor, but their spells make them resistant to Plasma-type damage and allow them to regenerate Health in battle. The Mages, like the Commandos and Reverends are the paragons of the human race: the empire builders."
  STR_HUMAN_NOBLEWOMAN_UFOPEDIA: "These members of pureblood high society can be ransomed to their worried families for a sizeable bag of cash. Don't understimate them, though, as they are fairly well trained to fend off any would-be molesters (and this includes VooDoo training)."
  STR_HUMAN_FATMAN_UFOPEDIA: "These rich guys are slow and very easy to catch. They should lose some weight since it's not even fun. The only 'weapons' they normally carry are booze and cash."
  STR_EXPERIMENT_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA: "The mutants freed from the clutches of these ugly Academy wenches, are, naturally, quite willing to show us appreciation for their freedom. For that reason, I think it would be good to keep them around for a while. Not like we can do much else with them, anyway, right, Cap'n?"
  STR_DAMSEL_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA: "Young females, kidnapped by various brutes for their beauty (as in, physical health and the right amount of tender meat), either for slavery, consumption or organ harvesting. We get a lot of good press for freeing them, and we can either ransom them back to their home communities for some nice coin (however at a discount), or introduce them to our big and growing family here."
  STR_MAIDEN_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA: "This girl, in her sweet voice, keeps preaching how we all are blessed and loved by the Higher Powers and how her life was saved due to her unyielding (and apparently blind) faith in the universal order and, wait for it, human goodness. At first we took her for just another Church of Sirius wacko, but she's far too charming for that, and smart enough to not tell anything of substance. When pressured, she gave out that she is an initiate in something called the 'Templar Order', but it was impossible to ascertain what that is. The girl seems to accept whatever is coming to her with an annoying optimism. If she wants to help the 'sinners' so much, we have an idea how she can help us..."
  STR_WANDERER_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA: "Like the name implies, Wanderers are guys who wander around the planet, doing odd jobs and getting into trouble. Such trouble might mean getting captured by various bad types, and then rescued by us, as it turns out. Not exactly the worst outcome, I daresay. The Wanderers are too independent to be of any use except for interrogation. And that's for the better, they're good men and having them around will run us a serious risk of gals getting involved and not interested in doing any fighting anymore."
  STR_BUGEYE_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA: "I have little idea why someone would want to go to the trouble of capturing and enslaving Bugeyes. They're almost useless as a workforce and too smart for their own good. The Bugeyes themselves say that they were used as guinea pigs for drug related experiments, but who'd believe them? Maybe the Mutant Alliance will be interested in accepting these good-for-nothings."
  STR_RAYNERD_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA: "These are the Mutant Alliance's special operatives. They're creepily handsome and in possession of weird mutant powers. Something tells me that it's better to get rid of them as soon as possible. We can either sell them out or return them to the Alliance for a hefty price."
  STR_SISTER_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA: "Some of our sisters who shared our misery at Academy experimental camp have either stayed behind, or gone missing during our escape. It also stands to reason that like-minded souls have fallen on bad times elsewhere in this cruel world. Such people can be rescued and invited into our ranks ('Recruit' under Workshop's 'Recruitment' category; after the project is completed, she'll take 24 further hours to orient and recuperate). Fighting ranks, or even Brainers' ranks - the latter after further research. Or we can make them our slaves - like I said, it's a cruel world."
  STR_DAMSEL_SACRIFICE_UFOPEDIA: "A.K.A. 'Damsel In Lethal Distress, Ohhh!'{NEWLINE}This Pureblood escaped her sheltered life in the seek of adventure... and look where it has gotten her. We can return her to her family for a quite sizeable ransom of $65k, or maybe we can put her to some 'good' use here? Oh, she also screams that she wants to join our sisterhood, but you're not taking this seriously, Capt'n, are you?"
  STR_HUMAN_LABOURER_UFOPEDIA: "These hardy folks toil endlessly, and hopelessly, in mines, factories, power plants and other industries - in those countries that have any industry, naturally. Upon their backs, the entire might of their local governments (and perhaps, even the Stellar Empire) is built, yet they get very little in return. Thankfully our job is a hell of a lot better."
  STR_BEASTMEN_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Status: CLUELESS MASSES{NEWLINE}While the upper classes are comprised of Purebloods, and slums and villages occupied by Mutants, Beastmen make the rest of Earth's population. Beastmen are distinct from the other two groups by three factors; first, they're a mix of human and animal genes (as opposed to mutants, who were artificially engineered using alien DNA); second, they could never pass for humans; third, while often cunning - intelligent even, they are prone to emotional outbursts and generally lack the spiritualism and critical thought of the other two groups, making any intellectual growth impossible. Most of them, like Cowmen and Sheepmen, are rather docile, but even those who aren't - be it highly successful middle-class Wolfmen, or primitive savages living in the woods, while dangerous, are easily scared, distracted or manipulated, which makes them sort of perfect citizens, according to the ruling class."
  STR_WEREWOLF_WARRIOR_UFOPEDIA: "The Werewolves are amongst the most feared of the wild Beastmen. They charge right at you, eager to feast on your entrails. Their legs are fast and their senses are keen, allowing to see in darkness, smoke and through camouflage. They're also known for their limited ability to regenerate health in battle."
  WEREWOLF_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "The hide of a Werewolf is considerably tough, but weak to fire and associated damage types. NV: 20; ThV: 50%; SPOT: 5. CAMO: 10/4"
  STR_SECURITY_AUTOPSY: "Aqua Plastics"
  STR_SECURITY_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Almost as hard as diamond, while not much heavier than water and not much more brittle than iron, this material is grown in biochem factories. The main component of commonly worn Security and Carapace armor, usually mixed with other materials to form composite plating; varieties of such plating are too many to count, each with slightly different attributes. We can extract Aqua Plastics from damaged armor to fashion tools or armor of our own.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 4,000"
  STR_SECURITY_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "A class of expensive human armor, mass produced by Marsec and used by several major players. It is constructed from Aqua Plastics, thin impact plates over a skin-tight suit. This arrangement is both light and resistant to firearms, but has weakness to Laser and Chem damage. Sometimes a Durathread overcoat is worn over it to alleviate these problems. Extras include an air filter (upgradeable to a full life support) and nocto/thermal vision of at least decent quality."
  STR_HUMAN_POWER_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Some considerably well-off humans wear these Marsec-produced, imposing and expensive suits of armor, composed of Plastasteel plates, backed by powerful, yet cumbersome, servos. The bulky appearance might be misleading, as the armor is actually quite thin, just angled to deflect attacks and to leave a lot of internal space for machinery and personal gear. This arrangement causes some melee attacks to just bounce off (flat 20% Evasion). The suit is fully sealed and can be used in space; it is also equipped with very good NV/ThV. We could perhaps repair recovered suits, but this would require a better understanding of how the power source and other mechanisms work."
  STR_MEGASCORPION_STING_UFOPEDIA: "Believed to increase sexual potency; other than that, useless.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 10k"
  STR_SPIDER_SILK_UFOPEDIA: "A beautiful thread produced by these beautiful creatures. Stronger than steel, but easily cut and quick to decay. Can be useful for bows.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 2,000"

  STR_SECTOID_UFOPEDIA: "Status: GLOBAL POWER{NEWLINE}The 'Academy' is a vast all-female order sponsored by the Star Gods' Governor. They are charged with exploring the ever-shifting wasteland that is Earth and researching new forms of mutated life. In practice, they scout mutant communities and indirectly help to efficiently police them. They particularly covet sorcerous powers and unquestionably are their most famous practitioners, after the Star Gods themselves. Most of them use standard human equipment and can be easily looted, but the Academy is perfectly able to put its vast resources to work and deploy high-tech guns and robotic weapons."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_UFOPEDIA: "This race developed in an extremely hostile environment. They are extremely tough and can resist extreme temperature variations. Their mobility depends on a snake-like giant 'foot' which protects all the vital organs. Their objectives appear to be purely predatory and they appear to be under the command of some other intelligence which directs their military-style incursions on earth."
  STR_OSIRON_UFOPEDIA: "Status: ACADEMY SUB-FACTION{NEWLINE}Osiron is an important department within the Academy, responsible for security, industry and menial labor. It is theoretically autonomous from the Academy proper, but in fact they stick together like two halves of one thing. The security guards we combat when dealing with the Academy are Osiron men, as well as many other members who perform tasks that Academy sorceresses find unworthy of their attention. Because these two organizations work so closely together, Osiron teams are often accompanied by Academy Espers who provide all sorts of psionic aid. Osiron is basically the place where all the Academy's males can be found."
  STR_ACADEMY_RECRUITMENT: "Academy Recruitment"
  STR_ACADEMY_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "The quest to become one of the Academy begins at a very early age. Children attend all-female boarding schools, most of which are located in the countryside and co-financed by the Academy. After a very strict selective process that continues till the age of 18, only the smartest students are allowed to compete for enrollment into one of Academy's universities - Scientific and Medical Academies. Graduates of the former become Researchers, the latter - Nurses. The most prestigeous are Astro Academies, which deal primarly with arcanist students and post-graduate Explorers. The numerous dropouts don't have it easy - some succeed with the Guild, the Church or local administration, but many are forced to take jobs as maids, waitresses or outright prostitutes."
  STR_ACADEMY_HIERARCHY: "Academy Hierarchy"
  STR_ACADEMY_HIERARCHY_UFOPEDIA: "The Academy comprises of three main Cathedrals, identifiable by badge colors, supposedly styled after the mythical Knights of Cydonia themselves.{NEWLINE}>Technical Cathedral (Red): They're tasked with supervising and researching machinery and 'hard sciences'. Ranks: Researcher, Engineer, Scientist.{NEWLINE}>Medical Cathedral (Green): They oversee physical and mental health of Earth's peoples. Ranks: Nurse, Medic, Counselor.{NEWLINE}>Astro Cathedral (Blue): These elites study the power of the mind, and supervise all the other Academicians. Ranks: Supervisor, Esper, Provost. Provosts form the Collegiate, which rules over all the Academy.{NEWLINE}>Students are at the very bottom and do the hardest work. Explorers take dangerous duties to be admitted into Astro Cathedral from either of the two others."
  STR_ACADEMY_LEGACY: "Academy's Legacy"
  STR_ACADEMY_LEGACY_UFOPEDIA: "You're one with us. It is we, the Academy, who created you. Neither your savage villages you barely remember, nor that Dr. X of yours, but it was us who taught you how to think, and what to think. You try to deny it, but just think a little: don't you find males brutish and inferior? But you only recently got to know any males at all. Like us, you seek to claim your privilege, to live a comfortable life amongst this sea of chaos. With your escape, you became a mere delinquent who wants punishment. Even if you keep running, you will only recreate what we are in a new form. After all, what is there to life but to seek pleasure? (-300 Infamy)"
  STR_ACADEMY_PURPOSE: "Academy's Purpose"
  STR_ACADEMY_PURPOSE_UFOPEDIA: "The Star Gods pursue an unending quest of gathering data on all possible paths of evolution. This seems like a major reason for conquering more and more worlds. They have created the Academy for the singular purpose of gathering biological and psychological data from all over the world, then sending it to Mars for the Governor-Brain to process. Nobody in the Academy needs or really wants to know all of this, as long as they can enjoy their privileges."
  STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY: "Integrated Devices"
  STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "We took time to carefully poke around the looted belongings of an Academician and found a bunch of smart tools used in their trade. Additional inquiry into this topic could perhaps allow us to devise something useful.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 1,250"
  STR_SNAKEMAN_AUTOPSY: "Snakeman autopsy"
  STR_SNAKEMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The skin is extremely tough and heat resistant. The cardio-vascular system is part of the muscular system which uses the hydraulic principle to create motion. The only true muscle is the 'heart'. The reproductive system appears to be very efficient. Reproduction is asexual, with each snakeman carrying up to fifty eggs inside its body at any one time. Left to its own devices this species would be a severe threat to life on earth."
  STR_GUILD_UFOPEDIA: "Status: GLOBAL POWER{NEWLINE}The Traders, unlike the population at large, are allowed to freely travel around the Earth and barter their goods. They are crucial for the Star Gods overseers to maintain control over the planet, keeping the smaller local govts from attaining too much economic autonomy. The Traders have access to Stellar Empire technology and possess great wealth in ships and other goods. They are the prime target of our operations."
  STR_MARSEC_UFOPEDIA: "Status: GUILD SUB-FACTION{NEWLINE}Marsec is the military arm of the Guild. The name comes from Mars, where its HQ resides. The Guild evolved from a global effort to colonize Mars under the Star Gods' blessings. Marsec is an organization with the authority to protect Guild's holdings in the Solar System and beyond, chief amongst them the Hellerium mines. While it's not easy to travel to Mars (unless the Guild hires you), it's there where the best-equipped pureblood soldiers can be found."

No interstellar smuggling operation can succeed without having help from within tranS-Stellar."
  STR_GUILD_RECRUITMENT: "Measuring Souls"
  STR_GUILD_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "The Guild is a giant machine, built from humans. Each one is a cog. But it is difficult to make a machine in which every cog is different. That's why we need precise measurements of people. Which would be expensive, but we managed to commandeer the help of Academy's and Church's educational systems. Endless examinations and evaluations they subject their students to is their contribution towards our cause, an important element of our alliance. The actual knowledge they teach (or what passes for it) is irrelevant to us."
  STR_GUILD_AUTOPSY: "Durathread"
  STR_GUILD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A fabric of unearthly origin; when worn as clothes, it provides some protection from energy, chem and electricity discharges, but not fire or plasma. It is also used in the form of 'Duratape', an adhesive wonder that is likely the greatest engineering invention ever and will undoubtedly lead to a major increase of our industrial capabilities - once we master its usage. I think we should start experimenting on Runts...{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 500"
  STR_CHURCH_UFOPEDIA: "Status: GLOBAL POWER{NEWLINE}From the lowliest neophyte to the high bishops, the Church of Sirius reveres the Star Gods with a fanatical fervour and tries to coerce everyone else into doing the same, peacefully or otherwise. Even if the Star Gods rarely respond to summons (and reasonable people prefer them not to), this does little to shake the Church's faith; the Star Gods are to be worshipped and obeyed without question no matter what they do, else they may get angry and extinguish all life on our planet. The Church is very useful to the Stellar Empire as watchdogs, scrutinizing the other major factions for any signs of disloyalty and receiving some modest rewards in exchange. Despite all this, insiders say that the Church isn't always 100% serious about its job..."
  STR_CHURCH_AUTOPSY: "Force Circuitry"
  STR_CHURCH_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The inventory of a cult member contains, unsurprisingly, a wide selection of 'holy' symbols, 'holy' books and other 'holy' adornments that'll fetch a fair price. However, it goes deeper than that. It seems that some of these symbols contain arcane circuitry. They can be used for tricks such as conjuring light, sound and holo images - but also can dissipate weapon attacks, giving their users an equivalent of body armor. Or transparent outfits. We definitely need to learn more.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 2,000"
  STR_MUTON_UFOPEDIA: "Status: FRACTURED INTERSTELLAR NETWORK{NEWLINE}The toughest, strongest and most ruthless of Earth's mutants can easily find employment in mercenary companies, that are more like private-owned military forces, armed to the teeth and extremely dangerous. It is ironic how their actual standing is obviously higher than that of pureblood human factions - while the Mercenaries work for anyone who can afford them, it is the Star Gods government who is their biggest customer."
  STR_MUTON_AUTOPSY: "Synthmuscle"
  STR_MUTON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The most interesting thing about Mercenary gear is the suits they wear. They seem to be made of artificial muscle-like fibres, that are, however, much tougher and stronger than human or animal muscle. Similar 'Synthmuscle' is sometimes used in other factions' armor as well. To continue our research in this area, we need to obtain knowledge from one of their engineers. Having access to advanced surgical equipment is also crucial.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 8,000"
  STR_ETHEREAL_UFOPEDIA: "Status: INTERSTELLAR POWER{NEWLINE}It's weird how little we know of the Star Gods, our self-proclaimed masters, beyond that they've conquered Earth at some point and now treat us as dirt. Now, after having interrogated one of them, we know that they prefer to rule our planet indirectly, using the great factions to do their dirty job and only intervening when necessary. Each and every one of them is incredibly tenacious, vicious and hostile; combined with their freaky magic they are not an enemy we want to fight on a daily basis. Luckily, they seem to need our people and economy for some sort of galactic war the Star Empire wages against some other freaks; otherwise they'd probably kill us all with a virus or something... {NEWLINE}All Star Gods have SENSE of 8 or more."
  STR_ETHEREAL_AUTOPSY: "Star God's Stuff"
  STR_ETHEREAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "We've checked the Star God remains carefully, but the only thing we found was this plain robe. While strong, durable and silky, it's still just a piece of clothing; we couldn't find anything of interest. There were no weapons, no grenades, no clues about their invisibility, no nothing! First I thought someone's nicked it, but now we're pretty sure that's not the case. How spooky. Some of them Gods seem to be ablaze with inner light. We'd better not even try to interrogate 'em afore we know more 'bout VooDoo."
  STR_STAR_GODDESSES_UFOPEDIA: "It seems the Star Gods have a similar organization to the Academy. While the Star Gods we know appear genderless, they're the male order of mages of their race. At some point in the distant past, they made a political deal with their female counterparts to create the Stellar Empire as we know it. The Goddesses (aka Witches), however, have their own ways. They do not conform to the iron rule of limiting mental exposure to aliens to a minimum, and instead directly meddle in the affairs of lesser races, often creating personal cults or developing bonds with exceptional individuals to be used as their agents."
  STR_NINJA_UFOPEDIA: "Status: RIVALS{NEWLINE}The Sky Ninjas are a long-established organization, flying camouflaged ships like we do, raiding this or that target and generally having a fun life. However, their philosophy is diametrically opposed to our own - like, they use more cunning and stuff. They're associated with the tribe of Narlocks and their champion, Jill, the mortal enemies of Lokk'Naars and their leader, Jack."
  STR_NINJA_ENDURANCE_TRAINING_UFOPEDIA: "Elemental endurance is a part of advanced Ninja training. By exposing themselves to elements, Sky Ninjas develop techniques to resist Fire, Electricity, Bio and Mind damage, as well as adverse weather. They also increase their mental and physical resistance that way. This has to do with their perverse VooDoo, and as such, is impossible for us to mimic. However, insights into their techniques can give us a new philosophical perspective on things."
  STR_NINJA_GAL_UFOPEDIA: "The foot troopers of the Sky Ninjas, these Ubers are almost as good as our Gals, but their cunning ways allow them to employ camouflage, making them invisible from a long range."
  STR_NINJA_WARRIOR_UFOPEDIA: "These Sky Ninjas are much better trained than the usual Ninja Gals, which means not only substantially higher combat skills, but also better camouflage. They're able to spot camouflaged units to some degree as well. They form the backbone of Sky Ninja assault teams. Do not expect them to show any mercy."
  STR_BANDIT_UFOPEDIA: "Status: UNORGANIZED{NEWLINE}Those who take from others to give to themselves: the thugs for hire, the outcasts, the undesirables, the riff-raff. Many of them have various arrangements with greater powers, allowing them to freely bust up those not in the arrangement. Some are even romanticized amongst the big city folks. But overall, nobody will really miss them."
  STR_RAIDER_UFOPEDIA: "Status: FRACTURED GLOBAL NETWORK{NEWLINE}Raiders are organized criminals, mostly mutants, who make a living from robbing everyone around them, be it government, factions or just normal folks. They aren't well equipped, but they're pretty tough and not easily frightened. In short, they're like us, but much less classy and definitely less awesome."

  STR_RAIDER_SUBCONTRACTING: "Raider Subcontracting"
  STR_RAIDER_SUBCONTRACTING_UFOPEDIA: "The conspiracy theories about Raiders conducting attacks with high-tech Faction weaponry and Faction warships turn out to be true. Despite official enmity with the Raiders, the Academy, Guild and Church are sometimes willing to clandestinely hire selected groups of Raiders for especially odious or dangerous tasks. They're lent powerful equipment for the duration, and if something goes very wrong, their employers do not risk an internal crisis. Similar arrangements are sometimes made with sympathetic Govt squads, and their official superiors have little power to prevent it, with Govts being fractured as they are."
  STR_SPARTANS_UFOPEDIA: "Status: LESSER POWER{NEWLINE}These mercenaries /scavengers /bandits live out in the wild, in hidden fortresses, forming a highly hierarchical and xenophobic society of 'survivors', or 'preppers', as they call themselves. They're taught to follow their holy book, 'The Rules of Engagement'. They pride themselves for things like personal liberty and the right to bear arms, but bear no disobedience towards superiors, namely old (oftentimes geriatric), accomplished warriors. Add to that an ideology of human racial purity and the subservient role of women in their ranks is not surprising. Facing a negative population growth, they replenish their ranks with insecure, young city dwellers. Most of these die rather quickly."
  STR_SPARTAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Some communities have mastered the art of weaving clothes from very sturdy fibres, which, while easily cut, are very effective at stopping bullets and shrapnel. The toughness of such armor isn't too high, but it is very often camouflaged. What's curious, the material bears no resemblance to any Star God technology. With some basics in armor construction, we could mimic this art.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 300"
  STR_GOVT_AUTOPSY: "Human's Stuff"
  STR_GOVT_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Except for good-quality clothing, some change and worthless ID cards, we've found nothing of real interest. But at least we learned how to use and even create social media accounts! I'm sure this will give us many opportunities to learn about the society of these OutZoners we deal with, or, as it is called in their language, 'to troll'.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 125"
  STR_GOVT_UFOPEDIA: "Status: MULTIPLE LOCAL POWERS{NEWLINE}The local Govts might not have access to such amounts of hi-tech resources as the big factions, but on the other hand, they command a lot of loyal people, as 70% or so of the global population is under their rule, as opposed to maybe 5% commanded by all the factions combined. The Govts might tolerate our actions, as we keep the global factions on their toes, and it's generally cheaper for them to pay us protection money, but if we make too many enemies within their ranks, we'll be done for."
  STR_GOVT_CORRUPTION: "Govt Enmity"
  STR_GOVT_CORRUPTION_UFOPEDIA: "While the Govts support us covertly, and understand the long-term benefit of working together with free mutants to curtail banditry and the influence of the Factions, they're in no way a unified front. Most govt officers are unaware of our status. Many are either corrupted, or have different beliefs. However, while they will attack us when engaged, we weren't granted the power of judgement and killing them will incur a penalty."
  STR_NAZIS_UFOPEDIA: "Status: LESSER POWER{NEWLINE}These guys, against all facts, strongly believe in the supremacy of pureblood humans over all other forms of life and are willing to kill anyone who disagrees. In short, they're dangerous lunatics and it's better to avoid them or shoot them on sight."
  STR_NAZI_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "The lads in brown uniforms can shoot straight and won't faint at the first sight of blood, but that's about it. They're only humans, unarmored and usually poorly armed. Not much of a master race, honestly."
  STR_NAZI_SS_UFOPEDIA: "These Humanists are named Instructors because they know how to read and write, they're well-versed in their faction's ideology, and charged with spreading it amongst disgruntled Purebloods. They're not your usual skinny scholars, though. To the contrary - they're well-trained and very tenacious types. Never relax when having one around - he may not die as easily as you'd expect of an unarmored Pureblood."
  STR_NAZI_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "While the lower ranks can claim that they're only 'following orders', these are the guys who give said orders. They're very well trained in combat and fanatical in their devotion to the racial purity ideology; thankfully, their fancy black uniforms have no protection value whatsoever - and look much better when sprayed in blood anyway."
  STR_NAZI_STORMTROOPER_UFOPEDIA: "They're strong, fanatical, and clad in extra-thick suits of carapace armor (NV 16, ThV 60%). Thankfully they're a rare sight amongst Humanist forces, probably because such armor costs a lot of bling."
  STR_NAZI_SUPERSOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "An especially tenacious Humanist crammed inside a heavily armored robotic suit, armed with two rapid-firing Gauss weapons."
  STR_NAZI_KKK_UFOPEDIA: "Many otherwise quiet Purebloods sympathize with the Humanists. We call them 'Ghosts' for the hooded robes they wear to avoid uncomfortable recognition while murdering mutants."
  STR_KILLER_DROIDS_UFOPEDIA: "Status: MACHINES{NEWLINE}These robots, undoubtedly illegal, are used by someone to enforce their will. Confronting such an enemy won't be easy, much less their masters."
  STR_TECHNOCRACY_TERMINATOR_TERRORIST_UFOPEDIA: "This model of killer droid is made in a shape of a human skeleton, with a fusion gun mounted in one of its arms. The weapon doesn't seem to be salvageable except for its parts, we have however found out its power rating (75) and that, while extremely deadly at close range, it should be much less accurate at extreme ranges. The droid is not only tough, but also boasts high accuracy and quick reactions."
  TECHNOCRACY_ARMOR_P0_UFOPEDIA: "The plastasteel shell of this droid makes it resistant to most forms of damage, most notably Piercing. However, once its armor is penetrated, the droid doesn't have too robust internal structure, making Laser weapons the most obvious method of fighting it. NV: 20. ThV: 70%"
  STR_TECHNOCRACY_MEK_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "There is something really weird about this woman, a certain stiffness of expressions, like she was a zombie or a doll. This contrasts with the inhuman quickness she is capable of in combat. Getting anything out of her was difficult due to the emotional coldness and contempt she shows towards us, but every ice can be melted... Apparently she is a cyborg, connected to the so-called 'Omega Network', a Technocracy command and control system that was being built in secrecy using Shadowtech to stay undetectable by the Star Gods; this somehow involves portals. She is an expert on constructing all kinds of cyber-zombies and other things cybernetic. She also speaks about some sort of a `White Queen` that is at the top of the network. Seems that the Technocracy is building an army."
  STR_TECHNOCRACY_1_CORPSE_BATTLE_UFOPEDIA: "What appeared to be a living, breathing, VooDoo using woman, turned out to be a very intricate doll, or a killer droid, take your pick. In any case, this is seriously creepy. The corpse contains organs of which functions we have no idea, and its nervous system does not resemble any sort of a droid we have heard of. The endoskeleton is powered by synthmuscle, and everything is supported by damage control systems. Even the squishy bits are not a simple disguise, but an integral part of the design."
  TECHNOCRACY_ARMOR_P1_UFOPEDIA: "The Technomancer uses a weird VooDoo weapon called 'brainhack', which cannot be opposed, but is only of moderate threat to organics as it deals EMP damage. NV: 25. ThV: 70%. SPOT: 8. SENSE: 20. CAMO: 0/3."
  STR_SMUGGLER_UFOPEDIA: "Status: INTERSTELLAR NUISANCE{NEWLINE}Smugglers are a joint human, mutant and outworlder enterprise. They lead risky, if profitable, lives by transporting restricted cargo all over the globe in their own ships, so, understandably, they're hardy and well-armed. The Star Gods aren't too happy, but Smugglers have fast and stealthy ships. If we manage to catch them, there will be a lot of booty, but don't expect our Infamy to rise noticeably. Owing to their adventurous origins and countless bar-fights, higher-ranking Smugglers are adept at dodging melee attacks, so be careful when engaging them up close and personal."
  STR_SMUGGLER_GOON_UFOPEDIA: "Professional gunmen are unsurprisingly numerous amongst various enterprising teams, like smuggling crews. They might not be as tough as the Guild henchmen, but certainly aren't pushovers either. Their cheap but effective armor is remarkably good at stopping low- and mid- powered bullets. Goons know a good deal about various weapons, which makes interrogating them worthwhile."
  STR_SMUGGLER_CATGIRL_UFOPEDIA: "These alien kittens are damned fast and wear strange suits that make them nigh-invisible. They're Smuggler's bodyguards, amongst other things. Do not think they're harmless just because they look fragile. Engaging in melee unadvised unless wearing scratching-proof armor. Catgirls are very hard to hit due to their agility and stealthiness, but they're allergic to smoke. NV: 20. INVIS: 5"
  STR_SMUGGLER_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA: "These furry creatures commonly serve as engineers and enforcers to Smuggler Captains and, despite their ugly looks, are as competent at maintaining ships as at ripping people's arms off. Insanely strong and very hardy, Bugbears hail from some remote parts of the Stellar Empire. Bullets and melee weapons will struggle to damage their thick bodies, but the fur looks curiously flammable..."
  STR_SMUGGLER_CAPTAIN_UFOPEDIA: "The unassuming outfit has fooled many, as has the charismatic smile, but these men are mortally dangerous. It takes a lot to survive as a Smuggler, even more so being a leader. Being experienced pilots as well as survivors, Smuggler Captains possess lightning reflexes, nerves of steel and deadly aim... What? No! I was totally not swooning!"
  STR_SMUGGLER_NEGOTIATOR_UFOPEDIA: "These ladies are the spies, the diplomats and the trade brokers. Unlike Captains, who run their own businesses, Negotiators are only present at major Smuggler operations, where they help to coordinate the efforts of disparate Smuggler groups for common interest. One of the things which make Negotiators dangerous are their unsanctioned VooDoo abilities. We can interrogate these bigwigs repeatedly to find out about various Smuggler customers, but this will take time."
  STR_STAR_GOD_PUBLIC_ENEMY_UFOPEDIA: "Stumbling upon a Star God upon a Smuggler ship was quite a shock. Luckily, your quick thinking, Cap'n, allowed us to take him alive. Surprisingly, he turned out to be a quite nice fellow, if really pissed at the fate of the Smuggler crew. Turns out that not every Star God supports the Stellar Empire and the guy is some sort of a rebel, preaching how they betrayed the idea of balance and how we're a savage product of a barbaric system, which doesn't allow us to join the Star Gods as willing servants. With that, he uttered one insult too many, but we learned something about the Star God hierarchy none the less. If we capture more guys like this one, we can sell them to Mercenaries for the enormous bounty."
  STR_NEKOMIMI_UFOPEDIA: "Status: INDEPENDENT EMPIRE{NEWLINE}The Nekomimi civilization somehow managed to flourish and achieve space travel without any interference by the Star Gods. Cunning and aggressive, they're still no real threat to the vastness of the Stellar Empire, but the Star Gods likewise are refraining from engaging in a direct military action, perhaps due to the rumored gigaton-sized warships the Nekomimi command. Being a much more primitive civilization than the ancient Star Gods, the Nekomimi still managed to come up with several unique technologies, and there might be a way to acquire some of these."
  STR_ANIMATRONS_UFOPEDIA: "Status: INTERSTELLAR NUISANCE{NEWLINE}Animatrons are sneaky A.I.s from space. They constantly travel the galaxy, trading, foraging and sometimes hunting. The Empire considers them a nuisance, but their homeland is a part of it, therefore they are tolerated. Animatrons can integrate with any machine equipped with Optical Processors, but they prefer humanoid forms. They are powered by a hellerium-derivative, called Alenium. A diverse bunch, some Animatrons promote peace and love in the galaxy, some are more interested in exterminating all protein-based life forms, so we better not trust them. If we happen to run into them and scrap a few, nobody would care."
  STR_MICRONOIDS_UFOPEDIA: "Status: INTERDIMENSIONAL MENACE{NEWLINE}The Reticulan legends speak of an alien race with which they have fought in the distant past on behalf of the Star Gods. Micronoids are intelligent aggregates of independent cells which possess host bodies as needed. Despite, or because of that, they developed frighteningly advanced Dimensional technology and used it to invade our universe through portals from their so-called 'Dimension X'. The Star Gods never managed to make heads nor tails of Micronoid tech, and it is unclear how the war ended, since most of the Reticulans involved were purged."
  STR_THE_SILENCE_UFOPEDIA: "Status: INTERSTELLAR NUISANCE{NEWLINE}There are little hard facts known about this menace, which brings the silence of death to whole townships and space vessels. It is not even known where they came from and how many ships they have. They first appeared a few tens of thousands of years ago, shrouded in powerful cloaking, ridiculously hard to destroy, and armed with antiquated weapons. Every attempt at communication since has failed. Their motives are equally unknown - they just exterminate every sentient being and destroy all computers, then disappear, without even looting much. The only sure defense - don't let them hear you."
  STR_MAGICAL_GIRL_UFOPEDIA: "These barely-adult girls have exactly that kind of immoral innocence about them that makes most males weak-kneed. They're also aggressively nice, playful and adaptive (see how she dresses after a few days here). What's perplexing though, they have no recollection of their identity or origin, or even the Well-wisher (whom they call the Goddess of Love, or of Cake), other than they found themselves aboard the ship with a deeply engraved mission of 'spreading love'. They also possess bits and pieces of strange knowledge and/or previous encounters, which they're willing to share fully."
  STR_MAGICAL_GIRL_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA: "This gem is where the actual soul of a 'magical girl' resides. 'Killing' her physical body has no actual effect of killing the girl herself; the body is just a surrogate that can be re-produced by this gem, given enough time, biological matter and ambient energy (Hellerium works perfectly well, although electric current and sunlight will also do, only orders of magnitude slower); this works in a similar fashion as the fabled Regeneration Chambers. It is possible to influence this process (and the kind of body produced) by providing certain substances to the gem - we'll need the understanding of Genetics and Surgery Units to do that. I guess this makes a 'magical girl' some sort of a bio-cyborg, quite possibly constructed by the Well-wisher herself."
  STR_JIM_UFOPEDIA: "His name is Jim. Where he came from, or what he is, he's not telling. He just wants to be called Jim, and says that he won't leave, because we're his 'personal harem'. His mischevious ways are best left unmentioned, but he can help defend our Hideout from ne'er-do-wells, even if he himself might... not always behave well."
  STR_GNOME_UFOPEDIA: "The Gnome we caught sure looks cute, but there's something deeply unsettling in her eyes, Cap'n; it's like being watched by an ancient evil. Bad mojo. There might be some truth to the tales of her longevity, as she speaks of the Old World like it was yesterday. It's like talking to a child and a very old man at the same time; she's disarming, immoral and threateningly intelligent. It's a monster, Cap'n, and how do we make use of such a monster? She already commented that she likes the Hellerium ambience of our Hideout, but is kinda afraid of being all alone in here with all us 'big, feisty brutes'... For now we can milk her for all knowledge she is willing to share." 
  STR_GNOME_MAD_UFOPEDIA: "This creature, however small and cute she might appear, is chaos incarnate. She's filled with all-consuming, murderous fury to the tips of her ears, and that fury is backed by surprising strength and a truly diabolical intelligence. Releasing her from her chains would surely result in unpredicable damage. However, I figured out that we can calm her down, if we can sate all her perverted needs. It's gonna be a tall order for the Runts, though."
  STR_AQUATOID_UFOPEDIA: "Status: MASTERS OF THE DEPTHS{NEWLINE}While the Deep Ones are dumb savages, more a force of nature than real people, Aquatoids form the core of the huge T'Leth civilization that thrives beneath the oceans. They're distant relatives to Reticulans, but while equally smart and magically gifted, are much less lazy and more vicious. They wield strange technologies of T'Leth, like the dreaded Sonic weaponry, and don't give a damn about either human or Star God laws. They're not impossible to reason with, although they seldom see the need to talk to surface dwellers."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_UFOPEDIA: "Status: GLOBAL NUISANCE{NEWLINE}It is not clear when the Deep Ones rose from the sea, but nowadays they occupy huge swathes of land, mostly in coastal regions of the equatorial zone, and are a serious danger to neighboring lands, as they're huge in numbers and definitely hostile. They seem to worship some sort of 'Old Gods' or whatever - these Gods aren't the same as Star Gods, but aren't their enemies either, and are said to live in the sea. They're also apparently at least equally nasty."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_NOMAD_UFOPEDIA: "Deep One nomadic tribes can be found under the surface of the sea, hunting fish or drifting until they're summoned by their gods to war or menial labour - usually through their shamans, who commune with much more intelligent Aquatoids.  While these Deep Ones aren't as battle-hardened as those who can be found on land, the aquatic environment gives them an edge in combat, especially in dodging and dishing out melee attacks."
  STR_AQUAMAN_TERRORIST_UFOPEDIA: "This monstrosity is as funny as it is horrifying. It appears to have been a human once, but has been altered with such a cavalier gusto that not much of the original remained, save the general body plan and the eyes. No longer a human but basically a living robot, it is equipped with a terrifingly powerful electricity-based weapon and protected by Aqua Plastic armor that looks rather grown than grafted. The lobotomized brain hides an Aquatoid-made computer device. Aquamen are said to be sent by Aquatoids to steer Deep One migrations. They are however not sentient, and can only chant pre-programmed orders."
  STR_DEEP_ONE_CHANTS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Cross-referencing the eerie chants sung by the Deep Ones with the writings of the Church brings striking realizations. Not only are the Elder Gods worshipped by both the same beings, but also the Deep One language seems to be related to the secret language Church honchos are using. One phrase recurs - 'the Old Gods will return'. They also convey a great deal of techno-mystical info Deep Ones obviously can't comprehend..."
  STR_DREAMS_OF_THE_DEEP_UFOPEDIA: "We all dreamt, Cap'n. There is an ominous, all-powerful entity deep beneath the waves, worshipped by Deep Ones. It invaded our dreams with visions of oceans, sunken cities, fishes and cold tentacles, everything of which was weirdly arousing and inviting. The Dreamer knows about Star Gods and Shadowmasters, but has no interest in them. Only in minds and hearts..."
  STR_ZOMBIE_DREAMS_UFOPEDIA: "Our research into Zombie consciousness finally allowed us to understand its nature. You could say that Z's live in a dream, and thanks to our VooDoo, we were able to enter these dreams. For Z's, there is little difference between reality and dream; they see the world like we would a cartoon. They are also able to communicate with each other, using these dreams, effectively creating a soft form of a hivemind."
  DEEP_ONE_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "The aquatic nature of the Deep Ones makes them especially resilient to blast waves and blunt weapons. Engaging them in melee is also unadvised for inexperienced warriors: the beasties are not only tough, but also quicker than they seem. NV: 20."
  LOBSTERMAN_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Trying to kill this lumbering monstrosity is a pure nightmare. Deep Ones use them as six-limbed tanks that can shrug off most handheld weapons. Even lasers, the usual can-openers, are somehow powerless. Their impressive plating is only relatively vulnerable to cutting weapons, but this requires getting close to these scary claws that can cut off power armor limbs. NV: 20."
  AQUAMAN_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "The Aquaman is a living weapon of the depths, a heavily changed, lobotomized human. It has a built-in weird electric weapon that shoots in an arcing trajectory (PWR=90). Its skin is literally made of Aqua Plastic. We could harvest it, but only with a help of Surgery. NV: 25. ThV: 25%. No Evasion."
  SHARKMAN_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "The Sharkmen are a tribe of wild Beastmen that somehow got involved with the Depth Dwellers, but seems to originate from the land. They're fast, deadly, tough, yada yada. There is some profit to be made out of butchering them."
  STR_RETICULAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This gel-like substance is definitely biohazardous. Its  practical use is hard to fathom, but we can always fence it for some cash.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 1,250"
  STR_RETICULAN_UFOPEDIA: "Status: INTERSTELLAR RACE{NEWLINE}Popularly named Sectoids, the members of that diminutive, big-headed race were once used by the Star Gods as footsoldiers, scouts, battlemages and analysts during the conquest of the Earth, then, as they have outlived their usefulness, abandoned.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Nowadays it's the Wild Sectoids whom one's the most likely to meet: degenerated remnants of these proud forces, their very survival depends on the ancient technology they barely understand - as they can neither eat or reproduce without it. However the Stellar Empire still uses Reticulans on many worlds, and some are seen on Earth as the Star Gods' honor guard. These 'other Sectoids' are smart, well-equipped and think nothing of their 'earthly' brethren. All Reticulans have natural Heat Vision of 80%."
  STR_RET_PEON_UFOPEDIA: "These little guys are common members of the Reticulan society, usually seen doing agricultural work or visiting tradeposts. They represent the archetypical traits of a Reticulan - lazy and dirty (in many ways), but at the same time curious, optimistic and adaptative. They wear conic hats and goggles, since they're very sensitive to sunlight (which also means they see really well in the dark), and show disregard for any other clothing, so typical for their race. They're weak, but quite smart. They closely resemble the original Reticulans, with their atrophied reproductive and digestive systems, and complete immunity to gas weapons, but aren't considered pure by the higher castes, who are obsessed with creation of a super-Reticulan of sorts."
  STR_RET_HYBRID_UFOPEDIA: "Hybrids are a broad category of the various half-humans, half-reticulans who have been constantly created for hundreds of years by the Reticulan society. Thanks to their ancestry, they're really bright and make even better mages than the Reticulans themselves, but since they don't resemble the perfect Ret much, their talents are stifled and they're mostly used for menial work. No wonder many of them flee to settle down in mutant towns or join bandits, and many of them can reproduce with humans, which makes us more Hybrids."
  STR_RET_SIREN_UFOPEDIA: "The animalistic, clawed Sirens are dangerous combatants, combining an agile body with Reticulan reflexes. Still, they're sort-of failed experiments in the Reticulan drive to create a Reticulan-compatible female who would free their race from the reliance on ancient cloning machines. It seems that the Reticulans succeeded with the task - to a degree. The human-reticulan hybrids who are actually able to reproduce (as well as other female slaves, who can always serve as natural replacement for artificial wombs), are well-guarded and cared for. The Sirens, despite their looks, aren't capable of reproduction but are well-suited for collecting 'gene samples' from all over the place, and thus can be interrogated for their knowledge of far-off lands."
  STR_RET_SECTOGRE_UFOPEDIA: "The Reticulans, in their obsessive quest for achieving natural reproduction and nutrition, experimented with human and other mammal genes. Their first successful experiments went a bit overboard, creating these hulking brutes. They're quite bright as such, but most of them are incapable of reproducing, despite their openly displayed, impressive equipment. These unfortunates are used for heavy labour and security. On the other hand, a few Sectogres supposedly can mate even with other races, producing various hybrids as offspring. The Sectogres are quite popular with ladies and are thus a valuable source of info about them."
  STR_RET_COMMANDO_UFOPEDIA: "These are ranking Reticulans, selected by the highest caste of their society - the so-called Progenitors - to order around Peons, Sirens, Sectogres and Hybrids. In a way, they're hybrids themselves - quite often biologically equipped for sex and/or eating normal food, but even if not, they're the smartest of the aforementioned bunch and trusted with some technological secrets. They wear camouflaged coats (CAMO: 10/3), weird energy shields (50/25, Purple), and are deadly shots with the quirky Reticulan weapons."
  STR_RET_ELDER_UFOPEDIA: "For a sexless alien, this old chap turned out to be quite a jolly joker - and a pervert to boot, I tell ya. If he's to believed, he's been alive for almost 200 years now, and he's just the last of a long line of clones, thousands of years old. According to him, the Star Gods would've fallen long ago if not for the unwilling help of the Reticulan race, who are their direct opposites - materialistic and down-to earth. Before he managed to bore us to death with his rants, or do something obscene, we managed to get him to share his knowledge of VooDoo in exchange for letting him go. He also shared some of his knowledge of genetics, but it'll take some learnin' before we even begin to understand it."
  STR_RET_MECHTOID_UFOPEDIA: "Inside this walking trashcan we found some important bits of Reticulan body, like the brain, the livers and the splanch, hooked up to a central cybernetic unit through a series of tubes and plastic bags. Looks like this buddy was really unlucky even before he met us, but at least he got a badass cyborg body (though it didn't really look very cool). The armour is very tough for its weight and can be a problem for light weapons or grenades... Anyways he seemed old and ill, and when we finally agreed to 'show him the goods' (as you can see on the picture) in exchange for information, we overdid a little and his heart gave out. Next time we better ransom them off to the Rets."
  RETICULAN_ARMOR_P6_UFOPEDIA: "Either our Hands smacked him really hard, or he was missing most body parts before he got inside. Like limbs. And he could still scream. Quite creepy, huh? NV: 20. ThV: 80%"
  STR_GOLDEN_SAINT_UFOPEDIA: "These are the messengers of Shadowmasters, who cross from the Shadowrealm to communicate with their confidants, eg. the inner circles of Smugglers. Golden Saints often bear gifts to their worshippers, and seem so saintly in their allure, that it is very difficult to confront them and not be awe-stricken. They travel through Tannhauser Gates and are impossible to either track or capture in that form. When defeated, they teleport back wherever they came from."
  STR_ERIDIAN_UFOPEDIA: "Status: INTERSTELLAR RACE{NEWLINE}Also called Snakemen, these xenos serve the Star Gods as shock troops, not too bright but very brave, resilient to environmental conditions and with a talent for biology and empathy, allowing them basic communications with most intelligent and animal species. If left unchecked, they quickly populate a planet with their offspring, hybrids and tamed animals, displacing the original population. We owe the existence of Lamia hybrids to their short unrestricted reign on Earth after the invasion. Nowadays, they can be met as warrior tribes, relegated to works the Mercs find beneath their standing. Eridians favor biological and chemical weapons, and have a natural NV of 18."
  STR_NUBIRAN_UFOPEDIA: "Status: INTERSTELLAR RACE{NEWLINE}Aka Floaters or Star Demons, these cruel xenos are Star Gods' faithful servants. They're tasked with pacifying countless star systems, especially those lacking in local collaborators. They are the backbone of the Space Rangers, an organization created specifically for this purpose.{NEWLINE}Aeons ago they built a civilization on a distant planet, orbiting two suns. Already challenged with an irradiated and erratic environment, they polluted their homeland almost to the point of extinction. Then the Star Gods appeared, offering them the cyborg bodies they're famous for. Sacrificing most pleasures of the flesh was a price the Nubirans happily paid."
  STR_MUTONS_UFOPEDIA: "Status: SERVANT RACE{NEWLINE}Mutons are the most faithful of Star Gods' servant races. Actually, it turns out they're the same race as Star Gods. In aeons past, the Star Gods, an order of mages, subjugated the lower classes of their race through their powers of mind control and bioengineered them into willing slaves. Not only servants, Mutons serve as hivemind of pure thought to which Star Gods link to experience gestalt consciousness. Mutons die if bereft of that link, making them useless in managing colonies like Earth."
  STR_CYCLOPS_UFOPEDIA: "Status: SERVANT RACE{NEWLINE}The Cyclops we have caught is just as dumb as it is strong. Engaging in small talk has proven as productive as one would expect. They just aren't really talkative, and attempts to make them more so failed - turns out, they're unable to feel pain, which could in part explain their huge endurance to damage. The poor sods are unable to feel much pleasure, either - we have checked. All these creatures seem to communicate is their dog-like subservience to the Star Gods."
  CYCLOPS_ARMOR: "Cyclops Examination"
  CYCLOPS_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "With a heavily armored shell and a sponge-like, dense body, this creature is basically a walking sandbag. Their gaze weapon isn't very strong but quickly strips armor away. Beside their toughness, they're also incredibly well-seeing. NV: 25. SPOT: 10. Thv: 100%."
  STR_ERIDIAN_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "The footsoldiers of Eridian tribes, they live for the glory of battle. While they can be communicated with, and understand the world we live in, they seem to occupy a slightly different plane of existence, filled with songs of their faraway planet, from whence they were summoned by the Star Gods to war."
  STR_ERIDIAN_BEASTMASTER_UFOPEDIA: "These snakemen are specialists who communicate with the beasts of war an Eridian tribe employs as heavy units. How they do that, we are not able to fully fathom, but this seems to be an innate ability of their race."
  STR_ERIDIAN_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "Eridian tribes have a loose command structure, but the smartest and meanest of the lot are called Warchiefs. It seems the Warchiefs employ energy shields (120/30, Blue) and other expensive equipment to appear important to outsiders, like the Mercenaries they often coordinate with; they do not seem like wealth-garnering tyrants."
  ERIDIAN_ARMOR0: "Eridian Examination"
  ERIDIAN_ARMOR0_UFOPEDIA: "The tough, lizard-like hide of Eridians protects them against many elements. They appear to feel at home even in hot and toxic environments. CAMO: 12/2. ThV: 50%. NV: 18."
  DANCER_ARMOR: "Exotic Dancer"
  STR_ZOMBIE_UFOPEDIA: "The Z-Phases are a varied and strange bunch that defies reason. At least we can tell that they multiply by the way of a parasite, are stupidly tough and powered by Hellerium. The less dumb forms also contain 'Zombie Juice' which seems to give them strange powers. Some of them are almost intelligent."
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE: "Zombie"
  STR_ZOMBIE_STERILE_UFOPEDIA: "Status: SPACE MONSTER{NEWLINE}So, we found out that the Space Plague is not contagious - at least not in the 'Z-Phase', as we call it. Proximity or even bodily contact doesn't impart the Plague. H-how did I f-found out?

But it's still not a zombie who lays golden eggs, sadly."
  ZOMBIE_STERILE_ARMOR: "Zombie Examination"
  ZOMBIE_STERILE_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "People turn into things like this when they contract the Space Plague. Interestingly, it often happens on Earth, but I guess it's a part of space, too. They're very slow on movement, but stupidly fast on attack. Killing them is a matter of quantity, not quality. The fables about shooting them in the head are just that: fables. Blind. SENSE: 40."

  ZOMBIE_GRUBAS_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "As it is to be expected, the sheer mass of this obese monstrosity translates directly into the amount of F-Force needed to blow it apart. Unexpectedly though, it appears to be up to 15% faster than its skinny brother, which is a most unnerving thought, to be blunt. What to expect next? Wild theories abound. Blind. SENSE: 40."
  STR_ZOMBIE_SADAKO_UFOPEDIA: "Status: SPACE MONSTER{NEWLINE}These tenacious Z-Ladies are quite well-fed, which proves they are effective predators. However, their main weapon is useless against fellow Z's, and their physical power is comparably subpar. Either they don't feed on Z-Phases, or have some other, yet unknown, ways of hunting. The size of their knockers does give me a few ideas about that, aye. Instead of milk, they steadily produce something that seems to be more 'Zombie Juice'."
  ZOMBIE_SADAKO_ARMOR: "Strix Zombie Examination"
  ZOMBIE_SADAKO_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "These female zombies attack by spitting noxious fumes (Chem damage) that sap one's Energy and drain consciousness away. The attack ignores 2/3rd of armor but doesn't damage it. The lingering smoke does not impede Zombies. The Strix is so voluptous because of the impressive amounts of liquid poison she holds in her body. She can explode when killed. SENSE: 40. CAMO: 0/5."
  STR_ZOMBIE_CARRIE_UFOPEDIA: "Status: SPACE MONSTER{NEWLINE}Singers take their name from their sad wails, as well as from the singing flames they employ to hurt enemies. In comparison with the usual Z-types, Singers are relatively unaggressive, almost shy. They generally do not attack other Zombies, which suggests a different mechanism of sustenance. In our tests, we were able to make a Singer do things for us in exchange for Mutant Meat. Singers seem to be vaguely aware of their status, which awful knowledge, I imagine, is responsible for their depression. Singers' bracelet is a receiver/transmitter device; yet, they can't talk. Camo: 0/3."
  ZOMBIE_CARRIE_ARMOR: "Singer Zombie Examination"
  ZOMBIE_CARRIE_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "These Z-gals are smaller than most Zombies, which translates into much lower endurance.

SENSE: 40."
  STR_ZOMBIE_PIMP_UFOPEDIA: "Status: SPACE MONSTER{NEWLINE}A Z with a sense of fashion, but no discernible intelligence. However, he does seem to experience a very strong emotion - love.

Caution is advised if you don't want to become like him."

  ZOMBIE_PIMP_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "These Z's move really fast and are surprisingly agile. Such negative development was to be expected, but these ones have one more nasty surprise - they can zombify people on the spot. Thankfully they're not much harder to kill than normal zombies. Blind. SENSE: 40."
  STR_TOMB_GUARDIAN_UFOPEDIA: "These big guys in plate armor seem to lord over lesser Zombies, through means unknown but probably some sort of non-verbal communication. They are undoubtedly Zombies themselves, but some much higher form, with all human organs functional. They can keep seemingly motionless for days, and normally appear very passive, but their senses are keen, and their actions can be surprisingly fast and deadly.

At this stage, its diet was changed to just enough Juice to survive, coupled with growth enzymes and addictive drugs to ensure loyalty.

Being such a diligent person, I've ordered butchering of its fresh corpse, and finally we got something. Beside normal human-like organs, the insides of Dark Ones are filled with a gelatinous substance we dubbed 'demonic essence'. After death, this stuff quickly breaks down, creating that foul stench that forces us to use so much space to store the Dark One corpses. The carcasses themselves are useless, but I think that with proper sorcery, the 'essence' could be harvested from freshly slain Dark Ones - it HAS to hold some dark power...

Curious. Well, the possession wasn't gone but at least he finally kind of calmed down. So, we proceeded to interrogate, but to no avail. After some milling about, someone had the idea that we need to turn to professional works in that field - and we happen to have an old tome called 'Malleus Malleficarum', which proclaims itself as the leading source on that topic. Sadly, when we put the demon interrogation practices found there to work, the patient died even quicker than a pureblood probably would, if one would be so ignorant as to use such techniques on a non-possessed person."

None the less, after we stripped the creature nude and examined it in minute details, the results were curious. Unlike its outward looks would have you assume, it lacks any male 'equipment' except the bare minimum needed for urination. We went back to corpses of killed Dark Ones, and all were the same on the outside - but at least a few had clearly female bone structure. Creepy"
  STR_DOOM_GUNNER_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}These burly brutes, dubbed 'gunners' for their preference of heavy weapons, are the strongest and biggest of the possessed humans, none the less, their toughness comes mostly from their patchwork armor. They do not seem more resilient to physical damage than a tough Pureblood, not even mentioning ourselves. However, there is a difference - they seem to be hardly affected by poisons, they're almost impossible to stun, and their fury is so all-consuming, they're completely immune to any compelling or threatening. However they react rather badly to any Evil VooDoo-related stuff, even if it's just trinkets. Now find me another subject, this one is of no use anymore."
  STR_DOOM_IMP: "Imp Demon"
  DOOM_ARMOR_4: "Imp Battle Report"
  STR_DOOM_IMP_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "We can only conclude these creatures didn't come from this Earth, but, quite literally, from Hell. These low-ranking demons throw fireballs at us like there's no tomorrow, which makes them quite dangerous. NV: 30. ThV: 50%"
  STR_DOOM_IMP_UFOPEDIA: "Fast and vicious types with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fire and a good aim. If your Hands aren't completely fireproof, underestimating them Imps only because they're not hard to kill can quickly turn our raid into a literal Hell. When up close and personal, they can also use their claws."
  STR_DOOM_HELL_BARON: "Baron of Hell"
  DOOM_ARMOR_5: "Baron of Hell Battle Report"
  STR_DOOM_HELL_BARON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "These towering monsters are very rare and very hard to kill. They appear to be demon commanders, and can conjure projectiles of extremely potent chem from thin air. The corpse is so foul it requires a lot of space to store safely and it's better sold immediately; there are various creepy characters willing to pay a nice coin for it. NV: 40. SPOT: 10. ThV: 60%"
  STR_DOOM_HELL_BARON_UFOPEDIA: "We thought we'd be able to somehow communicate with this guy, as he - or it? It appears genderless - but how to communicate when he doesn't speak, doesn't react to words, and any touch is harmful to deadly? One brainer said she heard it saying, I cite, 'Naebk'aesae Zaesraebae Ibx'o Avaxaer'vtae', but she probably simply made that up, if you want to know my opinion."
  STR_DOOM_DEMON: "Pinky Demon"
  STR_DOOM_SPECTRE: "Spectre Demon"
  DOOM_ARMOR_6: "Demon Battle Report"
  STR_DOOM_DEMON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This beastie can bite your head clean off. Especially if it surprises you in a loo. Luckily, I had my tool box with me and... nevermind. Well, they've come from hell, they have scary glowing eyes, but pumping 'em full of lead seems to work just fine. NV: 30. ThV: 50%"
  STR_DOOM_DEMON_UFOPEDIA: "A careful examination of this creature of muscle, teeth, fury and little else, revealed remains of what seemed like an artificial leg, fused with the monster's own hind leg. Was this creature once a human?"
  STR_DOOM_SPECTRE_UFOPEDIA: "Spectres are nigh-invisible, especially in the dark. Be careful for these jaws. When killed, Spectres turn into normal Pinky Demons - looks like the invisibility comes from their magic. INVIS: 20/5. NV: 40. ThV: 50%"
  STR_DOOM_CACODEMON: "Cacodemon"
  DOOM_ARMOR_7: "Cacodemon Battle Report"
  STR_DOOM_CACODEMON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "These big ugly ball-shaped ball-things hover around and spit magical shaped charges at their enemies. Their extremely stinky bodies are built like sponges and take little damage from bullets and lasers, better to rely on explosives. NV: 30. ThV: 50%"
  STR_DOOM_CACODEMON_UFOPEDIA: "No idea how it was able to float, spit plasma or, frankly speaking, live at all. Performance tests revealed its weapon has roughly twice the power of a Handcannon, but both speed and reactions were really bad. It took a lot to finally kill it, though."
  DOOM_ARMOR_0: "Bogeyman Battle Report"
  STR_BOGEYMAN_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA: "This demon-like humanoid is far more dangerous than it might look. Thankfully, it is not very hard to kill. CAMO: 0/4. SENSE: 3. NV: 30. ThV: 50%."
  STR_BOGEYMAN_UFOPEDIA: "This little creature is clearly unnatural; even if we shy away from using the word Demonic, that is what it appears. The creature doesn't appear to have any higher values; it is simply relentlessly mischievous and vicious. Apart from that, it seems to be only driven by hunger and lust, and if these are sated, it becomes less aggressive for a while - until bored or provoked. Ah... speaking of the latter. The gals need to be firmly warned about its lust-rousing mesmeric powers: even we have repeatedly failed to resist these. If not for our fail-safe contingency plans, we'd be goners!"
  STR_SHADOWS_UFOPEDIA: "Called by many names, they're a myth that keeps on living despite all Star Gods efforts to deny it. It is a popular belief that as there are Gods, there must be devils as well. Devils whom even the Gods fear. It is said they've waged a secret war for millions of years. Shadowmasters are known for bestowing powerful and dangerous gifts to those who they find worthy. Some say they're the same beings as Lokk'Naar gods. Whether it's true or not, this knowledge will open many doors."
  STR_SHADOW_PLOT_UFOPEDIA: "It seems that the game you're in is bigger than just the Academy, the Govts, Jack and the Mutant Alliance. You claimed the Drill as a sign from the heavens and crowned yourself as a Pirate Queen; but what exactly are these heavens? First they're sending portents, and now they're silent... watching, waiting? Who cares what they want; it is only important what you'll do. You need more knowledge, but it is impossible to say how deep the plot goes; therefore the only trustworthy information can be extracted from randomly caught prisoners. The dark path awaits..."
  STR_SHADOWTECH_UFOPEDIA: "Some of the crafts we can buy from the Lokk'Naars contain mysterious equipment slots, marked as 'STC'. It is impossible to tell what kind of systems or weapons can be mounted there, since they're unlike any tech we've ever seen. Their name is known only in fearful whispers: 'Shadowtech'."
  STR_SHADOW_CHASING_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}I must admit, that whole affair with the Shadows is maddening, Cap'n. We're basically surrounded by indirect proofs of their existence, from the dreams of the purple-eyed woman to weird ships and artifacts. Yet we know basically nothing of them, and no matter where we turn, our investigations immediately hit a wall. I tried consulting the Lokk'Naar, and they pointed out that some of the concepts described in our Codex strangely resemble certain myths about their Demonic Gods. Re-reading the Codex might get us some insights. This whole thing is getting awfully mystical, if you ask me..."
  STR_DARK_STAR_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The concepts behind Shadowtech are truly baffling even to mad scientists like us, Cap'n. Apparently the Shadowmasters put a great value in human emotions, and somehow use them to manifest improbable feats of technology, fully intertwined with magic. Our Codex is a proof of this; it alludes to an arcanist system, which describes the full spectrum of human emotions on a circumference of a star. Anger, Focus, Joy and Acceptance are the 4 positive emotions that flow into each other in that order; followed by their mirroring negatives of Fear, Confusion, Sadness and Disgust, and back to Anger again. Each Codex represents one +/- pair. The next concept is the opposition of Codexes; Red (Anger/Fear) is located opposite to Gold (Joy/Sadness), and Gray (Focus/Confusion) opposite to Green (Acceptance/Disgust)."
  STR_SHADOW_DESCENT_UFOPEDIA: "Those insane enough to seek the Shadowmasters, may eventually hear their calling. These forsaken souls feel irresistible call to a mythical place somewhere in the dark interstellar void, called 'Black Pearl'. If they make it to the destination of this mysterious and perilous journey, they're rewarded by 'Descent Into Shadow'. In this, they're consumed by the Shadows and are never heard of again. Are they destroyed, transformed into something or taken into another dimension, we do not know."
  STR_SHADOWREALM_UFOPEDIA: "We have divined that the beings behind 'Shadowtech' must reside in the 'shadow' of the perceptible world: a dimension where none of the physical forces we know works (neither gravity, magnetism nor nuclear forces). No Shadowtech seems to really rely on these. Instead, it uses two unknown forces we dubbed 'Dark Force' and 'Light Force'. Whatever they are, they must leave even the Star Gods puzzled. Or especially them."
  STR_LIGHT_FORCE_UFOPEDIA: "Once you accept Entropy, you realize that reality is chaotic. Everything is interconnected. Trying to determine it all is hopeless. True understanding of the Whole may only come from opening yourself up to its multi-dimensional flow and ignoring the mundane, measurable details."
  STR_DARK_FORCE_UFOPEDIA: "The path of each particle can be tracked back. Time is an illusion of three-dimesnional perception. Gravity is desire. Life and consciousness are direct expressions of the Universe. The understanding of these laws lays the foundation of the Dark Force. If you KNOW the exact path, the exact arrangement of matter, energy and information, nothing is impossible. You only need to WANT it bad enough and DARE to pay the price (as nothing ever is free). The final principle is to KEEP SILENT."
  STR_OTHER_DIMENSIONS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We have studied several strange phenomena, unexplainable by science we learned from Star God lackeys: demonic beings which employ weird energies; ghosts which can just ignore bullets and disappear. Not to mention the Shadowtech. Only the UAC Blueprints we found hold some clues, detailing long-dead company's research into harnessing transdimensional transfers of matter, energy and information. Our reality could be just a tiny raft, swirling in the sea of Chaos."
  STR_TANNHAUSER_GATES_UFOPEDIA: "Usually generated by magitech devices called 'Portals', or, as the rumor says, at Shadowmasters' whim. They lead to alternate dimensions, called 'Shadowrealms', where normal laws of physics do not apply. Matter cannot go there (barring specific exceptions), hence any traveller will transform into an astral form upon closing (see 'Dreamwalker' in Crew section). However things found in the Shadowrealms can sometimes be taken back here. Hellerium fired engines cause chaotic behaviour of the Gates, so we cannot use them on approach."
  STR_CYBERDISC_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature flying saucer, commonly used by the Academy, is the Star Gods' automated terror weapon armed with an extremely powerful plasma beam (Power 150) which the machine fires with high frequency and accuracy.  The anti-grav propulsion gives it a big advantage in difficult terrain. NV: 20."
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY: "Cyberdisc Wreckage Examination"
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "We have dug through the wreckage of this 'Cyberdisc' to find out if we can use this formidable machine to our needs. Good and bad news, Cap'n. Good news is, the machine is extremely robust, and the core anti-grav unit is repairable; we could bring this machine back and get it to fight on our side. Bad news is, we need a custom-tailored Slave AI to replace the current one. And there is the thing you're going to like the least - the plasma weapon it was firing at us is far too arcane to repair."
  ADRONE_ARMOR: "Academy Drone Examination"
  STR_ADRONE_UFOPEDIA: "A flying device used by the Academicians to scout dangerous areas and exterminate whatever findings they don't like. Armed with an average-powered laser weapon. Well-armored, but its inner workings are very fragile. NV: 16."
  STR_MARSEC_HUNTER_DRONE_UFOPEDIA: "A very fast drone designed to quickly find intruders inside of Marsec's vessels and facilities. SHIELDS: 50/10 (Blue). NV: 20. ThV: 50%"
  STR_MARSEC_SENTRY_DRONE_UFOPEDIA: "A powerful robotic guardian with very fast reactions. SHIELDS: 100/20 (Blue). NV: 20. ThV: 50%"
  STR_TURRET_BLUE_UFOPEDIA: "A robotic turret, fitted with vehicle-grade laser (125 PWR, 50% Armor Penetration). Watch out as it can use targeting data from other enemy units. NV: 16. DV: 30. ThV: 40%."
  STR_BOOMOSAURUS_UFOPEDIA: "Used by the Traders Guild as a mobile rocket platform, the Boomosaurus is a beautiful but ill-tempered beast. Making full use of their arcane arts of bio-engineering, the Traders equipped it with a rocket launcher, which the Boomosaurus can use by itself, though it has bad aim and is easily distracted. Raised to cause havoc and obliteration among those who treaded on the Guild's heel, these lizards are deadly to landlubbers, but we can make short work of them! Just don't use fire on one, it'll only get angrier."  
  BOOMOSAURUS_ARMOR: "Boomosaurus Examination"
  STR_BOOMOSAURUS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "As you probably noticed, this big lizard has a rocket launcher mounted on its back. The rack houses up to 8 incendiary missiles. Cutting through the Boomosaurus' scaly skin took some time, so perhaps it could be good material for armor. What we discovered inside was nothing special, but perfectly edible; it tastes best when roasted in garlic, and even better with some rum. NV: 9."
  STR_SHAMBLER_UFOPEDIA: "White Shamblers are big and strong biped animals, that inhabit caves of various cold areas of the globe. They stun or kill their prey with fists before dragging them off to their hideouts to eat later (wearing a strong helmet is advised to survive such treatment). Their expensive fur hides a heavily-muscled body resistant to Piercing and especially Concussive damage. The beasts are too dumb and too savage to communicate with."
  STR_FLOATER_UFOPEDIA: "The Floaters are primarily soldiers and terror agents. They are naturally predatory beasts, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced to make formidable warriors. The lower half of the body and most internal organs are surgically removed, and a life support system is installed. This implant contains an anti-gravity unit which enables the creature to float, albeit unsteadily, through the air."
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY: "Floater autopsy"
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The creature has been drastically altered by surgery. The device which seems to form the core of the body is a life support system, taking over the function of heart, lungs and digestive system. This would enable the creature to survive in extremely hostile environments. The brain is smaller than ours, but the sensory organs are well developed."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_UFOPEDIA: "And boom, who the hell brought this beast alive to our hideout?! The responsible (and I have a few ideas who would that be) should be punished, and not in the way they'd like. You, Cap'n, can enjoy this snapshot."
  CHRYSSALID_ARMOR: "Chryssalid Examination"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY: "Chryssalid autopsy"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The exo-skeleton of this creature is extremely tough, almost crystal-like, hence the (improper) name Crystalisk. The creature is infamous for its overwhelming urge to impregnate. While some Hands may find this exciting, the mate does not survive. Given the monster's extremely energetic chemistry, the victim turns into a fresh Chryssalid within a minute. SENSE: 8. NV: 25. ThV: 100%. CAMO: 8/4"
  STR_REAPER_UFOPEDIA: "So yeah, we have now our own pet Reaper that is running about the base, shedding hair and leaving teeth marks everywhere. I hope you're happy with that, Cap'n. Maybe we should construct some sort of a Reaper Pit under your bridge."
  REAPER_ARMOR: "Reaper Examination"
  STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY: "Reaper autopsy"
  STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This furry carnivore has powerful jaws and a voracious appetite. It's hard to put down for good, since it has two 'brains' and two 'hearts' (the latter are pretty tasty when fried with onion).  The Traders breed them to terrorize their enemies, but also for their hides that fetch a good price. Beasts used in warfare are controlled via cybernetic implants. NV: 16."
  STR_CELATID_CORPSE: "Torn Fartbag"
  CELATID_ARMOR: "Fartbag Examination"
  STR_CELATID_UFOPEDIA: "Our captured Fartbag seems to favor those of high magical aptitude - as its favorite food, I mean - so it must have some magical properties itself, but we never noticed anything special about it, naturally besides its uncanny ability to detect living beings. Which is strange and makes me a bit worried. Well, the conclusion is: if you see them, kill them fast."
  STR_CELATID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "They call'em Celatids, we call'em Fartbags. They spit acid and it melts people to slag. We're not sure where these little monsters came from, but they're certainly imported from some other Imperial world. The Beastmasters control them with magic. Fartbags are blind, but can detect any living being close-by, even through walls (SENSE: 20). It's best to hug cover or/and have a roof abovehead if one's around."
  STR_SILACOID_TERRORIST: "Rocky"
  STR_SILACOID: "Rocky"
  SILACOID_ARMOR: "Rocky Examination"
  STR_SILACOID_CORPSE: Rocky Corpse
  STR_SILACOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "We had to use a jackhammer to open this rocky pile of... You know what? Let's call him Rocky and be done with that. Because we haven't learned a damn. We're not even sure if it's a living creature or a mobile AC heater. SENSE: 20"
  STR_SILACOID_UFOPEDIA: "This little bugger breathes fire, chomps on rocks and is even less cuddly than it looks. Despite our best efforts, we failed to train it, as it only seems to respond to powerful magical spells that are beyond our best adepts. To make things even worse, we can't eat it any more than we can eat stones. In the end it, uh, escaped by digging a tunnel with its..uh.. let's call them teeth; the rock was both chewed and melted with acid. if I don't see it again in my life, I totally can live with that."
  SECTOPOD_ARMOR: "SECTOPOD Examination"
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY: "Sectopod autopsy"
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This horrifying machine is controlled not by some circuitry, but by a living, enslaved brain. It was doubtlessly forged in the very pits of Hell and serves the Star Gods where their evil magics fail and a vulgar display of brute force is needed. And yes, if we dabble into dark sorceries deep enough, we might be able to resurrect it to do our bidding. NV: 30. SENSE: 10. SHIELDS: 500/50 (Blue)"
  STR_SECTOPOD_UFOPEDIA: "Sectopods are cyborg creatures with a powerful laser beam weapon. The control of these mechanical beasts is via a telepathic link to their controllers, the Star Gods. Sectopods are protected by energy shields."
  STR_PYRAMID_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "This obelisk houses a wicked spirit which fires rays of baleful light out of its eye. The beams penetrate armor worse than laser, but cause a paralysing, extremely painful shock. Severing its base won't help destroying it; the obelisk can levitate in thin air on its own power."
  STR_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "WHILE THE DAMAGE OR ACCURACY OF A SINGLE 30MM ROUND MAY APPEAR UNIMPRESSIVE, THIS ROTARY CANNON FIRES A HELL OF A LOT OF THEM, MAKING IT QUITE AN EFFECTIVE ANTI-SHIP WEAPON. CLASS: LIGHT. RE-ARM: 5 HRS"
  STR_LASER_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "THE LARGE VERSION OF A VESSEL LASER WEAPON EMITS A HIGH-INTENSITY, FINELY-CONTROLLED BEAM. BIGGER HEAT SINKS ALLOW FOR LONGER ENGAGEMENTS. CLASS: HEAVY. RE-ARM: 1 HR"
  STR_PLASMA_BEAM_UFOPEDIA: "STELLAR EMPIRE'S STANDARD SHIP-TO-SHIP CANNON, IT SENDS PLASMA BOLTS ALONG A CONTROLLED-GRAVITY PATHWAY. EACH SHOT BURNS 1 UNIT OF HELLERIUM. CLASS: HEAVY.  RE-ARM: 10 HRS"
  STR_STINGRAY_UFOPEDIA: "OUTFITTED WITH AN ADVANCED GUIDANCE SYSTEM, THIS MISSILE RARELY MISSES ITS TARGET. AGGRESSIVE ENGAGEMENT TACTICS DECREASE THE TIME IT TAKES TO LOCK IT ON TARGET, BUT DEPRIVES THE ATTACKER OF THE RANGE ADVANTAGE. CLASS: MISSILE. RE-ARM: 3 HRS"
  STR_AVALANCHE_UFOPEDIA: "THAT'S A NUCLEAR MISSILE MY FRIEND. HUGE AND CUMBERSOME, IT LACKS THE AGILITY TO EFFICIENTLY ENGAGE SMALLER CRAFT. WON'T MISS A VERY LARGE TARGET, THOUGH, AND THEY'LL FEEL IT WHEN IT HITS. CLASS: MISSILE. RE-ARM: 1 HR"
  STR_FUSION_BALL_UFOPEDIA: "THIS LAUNCHER FIRES A BALL SHAPED PROJECTILE POWERED BY ANTI-MATTER REACTION. THE BALL DESTROYS THE TARGET WITH A GRAVITY WAVE IMPLOSION. CLASS: MISSILE. RE-ARM: 3 HRS"

This one has a scope, which you might consider a brave design, but it does help to hit your targets at long range. Plus, it looks extra intimidating, which helps to look serious and businesslike without any armor or clothing on. Don't know what a Magnum is? Buy and research it!"
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_HARPOON_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: "To appropriate treasures of the deep sea, one has also to face its dangers, so it's necessary to arm yourself! This weapon brings more firepower into the aquatic world of wonder. Can't find any ammo? Research the regular Harpoon Gun, we can't be bothered by such details!"
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_BANK_FAVORS_UFOPEDIA: "You are indeed not only beautiful, but supremely skilled! We here at Goblin Zaxx can appreciate skill. We will help you to make your enterprise grow. You're going to need equipment, and we can oil some cogs so you will be able to trade with the Authorized Dealers of ships and personal arms. Also, we offer very skilled managers and secretaries from a friendly Powermen HR company to help you with the increasing scope of your business."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_OGRE_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Clearing out the trash might not sound like a glorious job, but we at Goblin Zaxx know that no business is big enough to survive without it. Even more so, the bigger you grow, the more cleaning is necessary to keep you going. But nobody asks you to do it bare-handed! This gun will prove very helpful in fast removal of any garbage."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_HAND_MORTAR_UFOPEDIA: "Hand Mortar is a mortar you can fire, using a single hand. Meanwhile your other hand is free to make profits on something else! Time is money and we know that."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_MILITARY_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA: "Enter the market of real military hardware, and never again worry about shortages of standard firearms or ammo. Modern firearms can be purchased now, as well as Aqua Plastics, as long as they are researched."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_BIG_GUN_UFOPEDIA: "We at Goblin Zaxx understand well how gunboat diplomacy works - it is pointless if you don't have the guns to arm your gunboats with!"
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_SILENCED_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "Eliminate your targets quietly and effectively. Use either stealth or distraction to maximize Reactions, which are crucial for this gun. It will prove especially useful in missions which require both infiltration gear and quietness."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_MARTIAL_ARTS_UFOPEDIA: "So, do you wish to become a Warrior? Hard training is the only key. You need to develop proper training regimes, taking into account your advantages and disadvantages. Knowing yourself is half of winning the battle. I can only help you to make the first step. You must find out about your abilities, origins of mutants, healthy cuisine, sports and medicine, before you will be able to establish your own Dojos. Does your pretty head hurt already? No pain, no gain! Stop being useless!"
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_DURATHREAD_UFOPEDIA: "If you're lacking Durathread to make light armor and other stuff useful for covert missions, the Alliance can share. For a price. Our fighters are often outfitted with Durathread equipment and we run many small manufactures where we make it. Don't know what Durathread is? I recommend you buy and research some ASAP. Subpar equipment just won't do when the fate of all mutantkind is at stake."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_ALLIANCE_FAVORS_UFOPEDIA: "The Alliance needs your help, and is very glad you're part of the solution, not a part of the problem. To keep things that way, we will share with you the old SKYRANGER craft. Also, the Alliance Files are now available. For each one you research, we will lend you our tactical advice and use our pull to improve your political standing."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_ASG12_UFOPEDIA: "When working for the Alliance, precision is highly valued. However, brute force is often equally needed to deliver all due punishment to the enemies of mutantkind. This weapon, while quite expensive, combines both, as long as you're not a coward who disdains close-range assassination. It is also kinda heavy, but that's because it contains so much justice."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_SPIKE_ROCKETS_UFOPEDIA: "Mutant Rebels use and manufacture Spike Rockets by a thousand. From now on, we will freely sell them to your forces as well."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_M_LASERS_UFOPEDIA: "You have been a trusty ally to the Mutant Alliance. Trusty enough to be allowed to use our elite weapons, the Mutant Lasers. They are quite heavy and cumbersome, but it should be no problem for such big and strong warriors as yourselves."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_HOLOSUIT_UFOPEDIA: "Armor is so cumbersome and obscures your beauty. Employ stealth to avoid getting killed instead. If you dare."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_SAYA_UFOPEDIA: "So you couldn't help it and bought the shopkeeper as well? Such is the fate of ones like me. So here, you have me, do with me whatever you dare. In the messhall, right? Just remember that every deal has its limits, I have no obligation to keep you entertained, and you have certain responsibilities as my mistress as well. Neither will I stop answering to the Alliance, however, I can catch some birds for you... off-hours. What? You expected more? Grow up, kid.{NEWLINE}(-500 Infamy Penalty)"
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_CITY_PASS_UFOPEDIA: "The Pureblood cities may appear impenetrable fortresses, but in reality, there is a lot going on in their seedy underbellies, so to speak. This agreement with the Alliance allows us to use their underground logistic networks to infiltrate big cities for fun, profit and justice."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_PARTS_MC_UFOPEDIA: "Our standing with the Alliance and other customers, which caused an increase of trade between these factions as well, has allowed us to advance to a point, where we can commission Master Crafted Weapon Parts from the Alliance. This will cost us 400 Bounty Tokens apiece."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_WHITE_DRAGON_1_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Why use normal guns in day to day work, if the task can be carried out cleaner and easier by using fancy guns?

  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_LUNAR_WARD_UFOPEDIA: "It is not the ability to release energy that makes a wizard. It requires something more subtle and elegant... something called magic. The realm of possible impossibilities. It is only when you withstand a direct hit with a Ghost Beam and - just smile - then, the truly impossible happens."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_WIZ_BOOKS_UFOPEDIA: "Welcome to the Wizard Library. I am your servant. We can share with you rare tomes on arcane items and creatures. The fee is 50 Tokens and $50k per book. Please note that you will likely need your own Library to understand them... But of course you have one, excuse me for being silly..."
  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_WHITE_RABBIT_UFOPEDIA: "They are said to control time. So a nice hot bath never needs to stop."

  STR_UNARMED_WRESTLING_UFOPEDIA: "This type of unarmed attack is much slower and much more exhausting than a punch, as it involves full body contact with the opponent. It ignores half of enemy's armor, as well as inflicts serious Energy, Time Units and Morale secondary damage (x4). It has two modes: Hand Wrestle and Thigh Wrestle. The former is faster, while the latter allows to jump the enemy as a reaction move. High TUs do not allow to make this attack more frequently.{NEWLINE}Severe accuracy penalty when one hand is occupied."
  STR_UNARMED_GAUNTLET_UFOPEDIA: "Some armors are weapons in their own right. When wearing them, you can always execute a powerful gauntlet attack."
  STR_UNARMED_GAUNTLET_PLUS_UFOPEDIA: "This kind of gauntlet delivers more powerful attacks, especially when used by a brave warrior. It is also far better at defeating armor. Standard equipment of the Junkmaster suit."
  STR_GAUNTLET_CLAW_UFOPEDIA: "A gauntlet with super-sharp Plastasteel claws, just perfect for slicing throats. It is a part of certain armors. It can struggle with heavy armor, but if it hits true, it deals very deep wounds."
  STR_PUNK_CHAIN_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon is a part of Lokk'Naar Punk outfit. It doesn't cause Fatal Wounds, but it is pretty lethal otherwise. One-handed. Damages Morale."
  STR_KUNG_FU_UFOPEDIA: "Deadly forms of bare-handed (and footed) death. Require wearing proper outfit (like Gym Suit or Bikini). Flurry allows to attack up to 5 targets, but costs a lot of energy. Punch is fast, but less damaging.{NEWLINE}Reaction disrupt x2.5 (not with punches){NEWLINE}Average accuracy penalty when one hand is occupied."
  SPC_DA_HOWL_UFOPEDIA: "A savage scream can paralyze your enemies with fear (TU, Stun and Morale damage), while increasing your own Morale. Even screaming out into the wild increases your Morale a bit. The price to pay is the loss of 1 HP. Such screams are really exhausting."
  STR_KNUCKLES_UFOPEDIA: "While not being a particularly potent weapon, these can fit almost anywhere. Most fitting would be some ugly face, naturally. Causes highly random damage, potentially lethal. This is a weapon for strong, experienced warriors."
  STR_KNUCKLES_SPIKED_UFOPEDIA: "More lethal but also slower than your average fistycuffs."
  STR_FISTY_UFOPEDIA: "A dagger is so un-posh in this time and age! This cute little thing improves the ancient art of pugilism with the added excitement of delivering a crippling electric strike straight to your opponent's jawbone. Attacks with lethal electrical currents. It will be even more effective in the hands of warriors who can land a particularly heavy blow."
  STR_HANDLE_UFOPEDIA: "As the name implies, its purpose is to handle people without manhandling them, or, as some salty sea dogs say, to handlehandle them. Quite easy to use and doesn't damage the merchandise too much, most of the times (apply water to them if you have a suspicion of a skull fracture). Using it to the fullest requires lots of chutzpah!"
  STR_SHEPHERDS_STAFF_UFOPEDIA: "Every journey should start and end with a lesson on humility. And this weapon is simple enough to be used even by children.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Wielding Shepherd's Staff as a weapon reduces Cutting damage taken by 15% (to a min. res. of 30%), however this humiliating experience reduces Morale by 2/turn."

  STR_STUN_BATON_UFOPEDIA: "Shock people with electric voltage. Usage against armored enemies is not advised. Stun damage, no Health damage. Reactions are the key to using this weapon more effectively, but don't expect wonders."
  STR_SHIV_UFOPEDIA: "This makeshift weapon is easily concealable and easy to attack with, but the quality of its blade is rather unimpressive."
  STR_RAZOR_UFOPEDIA: "Can be used to cut throats or purse strings, as well as to shave your private parts - if you have a bald head to match, of course."
  STR_MACHETE_UFOPEDIA: "Fast and easy to use, but not very effective against heavy armor. Your choice, Cap'n."
  STR_KNOIF_BANDIT_UFOPEDIA: "A nasty-looking and quite easy to use blade. Inflicts ugly, if not very deep, wounds."
  STR_KNOIF_UFOPEDIA: "If everything else fails, you can use a dagger. Actually pretty effective even against armored enemies... if you manage to get close enough. Like in case with many light weapons, high Reactions are important in using it more effectively."
  STR_KNOIF_BARB_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy, vicious dagger which a strong warrior can use to inflict really nasty wounds. Weak and clumsy warriors will have trouble handling it properly, though."
  STR_CHITIN_KNIFE_UFOPEDIA: "This kind of primitive knife is very sharp and light, but struggles against good armor. It is also a fickle weapon that sometimes causes much less, or more damage, than expected."
  STR_LONG_KNIFE_UFOPEDIA: "A fine-crafted blade, made of polished steel with silver accents. Used by the Humanists to ritually dispose of their enemies. It is a physical manifestation of Humanists' belief that to strike true, you need both the physical skill and the mental will."
  STR_KNOIF_POISON_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy dagger, coated with vile poison. Very deadly, but takes a lot of skill to use effectively. Extremely useful against armored targets."
  STR_VIBRO_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon sports a thin vibrating blade, cast out of rare-element enhanced plastasteel to better carry its deadly harmonics. With better reach and higher damage potential, it is a clear improvement over a dagger, if costly to make."
  STR_PLASMA_DAGGER_UFOPEDIA: "A small yet very powerful melee implement, using sizzling plasma to deliver damage."
  STR_PRED_CLAWS_UFOPEDIA: "They look like just some fancy, serrated claws, but the self-sharpening electromagnetic circuitry woven into superconductive plastasteel blades proves their decadent and super-expensive nature. These claws won't simply stay sharp; they're getting ever sharper."
  STR_SHARK_GARLAND_UFOPEDIA: "Them teethy monsters think themselves so smart, trying to eat us with these big teeth of theirs. Our own teeth might be a teeny weaker, but we can use their own teeth against them! Arr mate, be it not a mouthful!"
  STR_PIPE_UFOPEDIA: "A solid piece of Plastasteel pipe, virtually indestructible hence the stronger the soldier, the harder it hits, with no practical limit. A strong Swabbie's best friend."
  STR_WRENCH_UFOPEDIA: "A coveted tool of many applications. In combat, it is effective at transferring your strength onto opponent's skull, and inflicts extra armor damage. They don't make ones like this anymore..."
  STR_RAPIER_UFOPEDIA: "A swift, swashbuckling melee weapon, great for weaker Hands since the damage does not depend on Strength. The Rapier also fares quite well against armor."
  STR_SLICER_UFOPEDIA: "This is supposed to be some sort of a medical tool. While it's rather dubious, it remains a fact that the Slicer can certainly slice stuff very well."
  STR_GLADIUS_UFOPEDIA: "A blade which employs harmonic vibrations to defeat armor. Like other swords, it requires good fencing skills to work best."
  STR_SICKLE_UFOPEDIA: "This farming implement can be used to harvest wheat as readily as to harvest due debts from the bourgeoisie. Slow to attack and not very accurate, but deals high bonus damage. Using it to fight properly requires high class consciousness."
  STR_AZTEC_CLUB_UFOPEDIA: "A spooky weapon used by primitive tribes. The spooky part is, it requires a pretty intricate manufacturing process, to fit these obsidian teeth onto a club in such a way they don't fall off. Not exactly primitive, if you ask me. The weapon itself deals a lot of secondary stun damage, is painful as hell, and rends armor. Wild rumors state that the fate of those not killed by it immediately and captured is worse than death... Although it does feature death, naturally. Only not so quickly."
  STR_RUSTY_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "This melee implement, although well-crafted, has obviously seen better days. None the less, it still can be quite deadly in the hands of someone who knows how to fight."
  STR_WRAITH_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "A kind of a sword that's sharper than it looks. Also it glows blue. Found only in the Shadowrealm."
  STR_SHORT_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: "A smaller, nimble blade that can be carried on your belt. Well-liked amongst the Lokk'Naars, hence the local name of 'Goblin Sword'. As the damage is more dependent on weapon skill and sense of timing than raw power, it is best suited for weaker Hands."
  STR_WAKIZASHI_UFOPEDIA: "These Fuso daggers were used to self-inflict a ritual punishment. One seeking atonement would publicly bare their chest and carve a grid of numbers onto it, using this blade, then proceed to carve correct numbers into the blank squares. Only by solving the sudoku puzzle before bleeding out were the guilty said to be absolved of their dishonor. The experience was said to be exalting but I fail to see why."
  STR_CUTLASS_UFOPEDIA: "This well-made melee weapon provides an almost-perfect-balance between accuracy, speed and power. Works reasonably well in newbie hands, as long as they're comfortable with the weapon's weight."
  STR_SWORD_MDV_UFOPEDIA: "Stronger than a Cutlass, but also slower. Not for weaklings!"
  STR_SWORD_PS_UFOPEDIA: "This plastasteel weapon strikes as hard as an ax, while being faster and far more accurate. It still favors strong users."
  STR_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: "An elegant weapon, accurate and powerful. Also, it electrocutes the enemy. It's not for wimps, though: user's physical strength is the fundamental factor when determining if they are worthy of using this advanced technology."
  STR_BATON_UFOPEDIA: "A big stick wielded by various police forces. Slow to act but tough on criminals."
  STR_VAMPIRIC_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: "This deadly sword is a conduit for vampiric powers. It nourishes the wielder with 30% of damage dealt returned as HPs and Energy, at the price of some Morale loss. Voodoo Power is as important as martial skill when using this weapon."
  STR_SLAVERS_CANE_UFOPEDIA: "A finely crafted Aqua Plastics cane, as we have learned to do when taking a gander at Deep One weapons. We made the plastic just the right rigidity, so it delivers a lot of blunt force, but softly enough as not to kill a captive. Using it properly and stylishly is an art in itself."
  STR_PEG_LEG_UFOPEDIA: "Maybe we don't need these for actual limb replacement, but none the less, no Pirate is truly complete without one! As for its uses... well, it can be wielded in your both hands to kick opponents - bet they are not expecting that!{NEWLINE}Special: By simply having a Peg Leg in her equipment, a Gal will receive extra +1 Morale, Energy and TU regeneration per turn."
  STR_TONFA_UFOPEDIA: "An efficient tool for knocking out enemies without killing them, but it requires some skill to use well."
  STR_BATTO_UFOPEDIA: "The origins of this weapon are lost to antiquity, but the name seems pretty self-explanatory."
  STR_BATTO_MAGIC_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon might look like an ordinary Ball Bat, but it shimmers with arcane energies. Strong adepts of Voodoo will find it particularly devastating.{NEWLINE}Special: Does not deal Fatal Wounds. Damages Armor. Huge extra Shock damage."
  STR_DISCIPLINER_UFOPEDIA: "A blunt weapon, used by the denizens of the Shadowrealm to capture their victims."
  STR_BONE_CLUB_UFOPEDIA: "Probably the most primitive weapon ever manufactured. Not recommended for use if you want the target alive, and indeed in most other situations too."
  STR_SPIKED_MACE_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy and brutal weapon forged to break armor."
  STR_IRON_ROD_UFOPEDIA: "Give it to an ogre. If you dare.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Magical Properties:{NEWLINE}>Regenerates 2 Morale per turn (stackable){NEWLINE}>Reduces Mind and Electric damage taken by 1/4, no res. limit (item slot: Weapon)"
  STR_GREAT_CLUB_UFOPEDIA: "Very heavy and unwieldy, but devastating when it strikes."
  STR_GOTHIC_HAMMER_UFOPEDIA: "This heavy blunt implement has been created as an armor-breaking weapon."
  STR_BILLHOOK_UFOPEDIA: "For all your psycho needs: cutting, slashing, disemboweling, you name it."
  STR_TECH_CLEAVER_UFOPEDIA: "A large blade, made by sharpening a slab of Plastasteel. Readily chops people to pieces, but lacks weight required to cut through heavy armor. Weapon of choice for maniacs and other loonies."
  STR_STONE_AX_UFOPEDIA: "Lighter and faster than a standard metal axe, however the primitive material handicaps its combat qualities. Best used in wide, self-driven circles."
  STR_AQUA_HATCHET_UFOPEDIA: "This ax is made of aqua plastic, which makes it very light and swift - perfect for broad strikes."
  STR_AX_UFOPEDIA: "Simple and brutal. May lack precision and swiftness, but when you hit, they'll feel it."
  STR_BATTLE_AX_UFOPEDIA: "A better weighed and sharper variant of the common Ax. It is not only more accurate, but also rends a little armor with each hit."
  STR_VIBRO_AX_UFOPEDIA: "Massive, hi-tech axe that easily cleaves through armor in strong hands."
  STR_CLAW_UFOPEDIA: "Cumbersome but deadly, perfect for gutting your enemies alive. Especially effective against meaty targets - deals double damage to Health. Good for overachievers."
  STR_SLUDGEHAMMER_UFOPEDIA: "A mighty weapon which utilizes the Power of Slime. It channels the Slime of the wielder into an explosive splash, which radius depends on maximum damage. Each use is very taxing, and it inflicts 80 Stun Damage on the wielder; however, any enemies dissolved by the Slime become a part of it, which heals Stun of the wielder. The Sludge Hammer has a 3 tile attack range. Requires Summoning Circle."
  STR_BLOOD_AX_UFOPEDIA: "An ax made in a dark ritual, menacing with demon's teeth, yearning for blood. Hits way harder than your ordinary ax, but is heavier as well. Any blood spilled by it buffs TUs and Stamina of the wielder (depending on damage caused and Bio Resistance of the wielder). Requires Summoning Circle."
  STR_FORCE_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: "A blade shaped from forcefields, instead of solid matter. Light, fast and lethal. Causes highly random damage."
  STR_PLASMA_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: "A highly destructive melee weapon, employing a blade formed from plasma. Very accurate, but rather slow, so it requires good timing skills to deal with interruptions."
  STR_POWER_MACE_UFOPEDIA: "This heavy mace devised by the Church's technomagery smites the offenders with baleful plasma energies. The alternate setting is used for stunning.{NEWLINE}Swing (Electric Stun dmg = as above, Skill = MA/2+STR/2, Acc = 90%, 20 TUs, armor/2, no armor dmg)"
  STR_POISON_LANCE_UFOPEDIA: "Injects enemies with a daring cocktail of toxins. Those who somehow survive this treatment without melting, will have to deal with massive secondary Shock, Energy and Morale damage. High Reactions and Bravery are the key to using this weapon effectively."
  STR_STUN_ROD_UFOPEDIA: "Prod the scurvy land-lubbers like the cattle they are!{NEWLINE}Causes Stun instead of Health damage and works fairly well through armor."
  STR_IMPALER_UFOPEDIA: "A strange spear which fires bolts energy that warp through armor and inflict stun damage. Very accurate with proper skill, although it gets 250% acc. penalties past the range of 14.{NEWLINE}In melee, it ignores 2/3rds of enemy armor and inflicts double Shock (STAB = 40+STR*0.2+THR*0.6, Skill = MA/2+TA/2, Acc = 150%, 16 TUs). Both attacks devastate enemy's morale and disrupt their reactions.{NEWLINE}Merely holding this evil weapon drains 4 Morale per turn."
  STR_CAT_PAWS_UFOPEDIA: "These beauties deliver extremely fast attacks, but when used against armored enemies, scratching, so to speak, is all they can achieve. Naturally, they work best with good reflexes and boldness."
  STR_PITCHFORK_UFOPEDIA: "A traditional tool of bringing down technologically superior tyranny. You can buy it from local farmers to hopefully bring down the Star Gods as well."
  STR_SHOVEL_UFOPEDIA: "The ancient masters of the killing art were known to use this unassuming tool to great effect. Don't laugh, it's true."
  STR_CROWBAR_UFOPEDIA: "Mr. Handy, always handy.{NEWLINE}Demolition +33%."
  STR_BOATHOOK_UFOPEDIA: "A spear with a hook. Therefore useful for both skewering and pulling.{NEWLINE}Special: Reaction Disrupt x2.5"
  STR_BAMBOO_UFOPEDIA: "One-handed, light spear, useful to handily impale someone up to 2 tiles away, as long as they're not wearing armor. Breaks pretty quickly, though. Low Close Combat penalty.{NEWLINE}Special: Reaction Disrupt x2"
  STR_AQUA_TRIDENT_UFOPEDIA: "One-handed pointy weapon, normally used to catch fish by some mutants. This one, though, could kill a white whale. Very accurate for a melee weapon. Like all spears, it favors warriors with good Throwing and Melee skills."
  STR_SPEAR_UFOPEDIA: "Lightweight two-handed melee weapon which is quite easy to use. Has a range of 2, but is less accurate in close quarters.{NEWLINE}Special: Reaction Disrupt x2"
  STR_PIKE_UFOPEDIA: "A stout two-handed weapon, with only 10% penalty if used 1-handed. Great armor penetration (-35%). Has a range of 3; accuracy is significantly lowered if there's an enemy adjacent. All spears favor warriors with good Throwing and Melee skills, but this one also requires decent Strength.{NEWLINE}Special: Reaction Disrupt x2"
  STR_SINGING_SPEAR_UFOPEDIA: "A high frequency plastasteel spear, it cries beautifully as it strips away armor. While it can undress your foes even faster than your Brainers could, it only has enough energy to last for a few thrusts so make sure to follow through!{NEWLINE}Warning: it still can and will draw some blood. Damages Morale and TUs."
  STR_BARBARIAN_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: "A big feisty sword, though not the sharpest. Takes a strong warrior to handle it. Has 2 modes of operation:{NEWLINE}>Whirlwind. Range up to 2, up to 3 targets. You can select the first target with CTRL+SHIFT+LMB, following targets with LMB. These attacks will have higher damage potential, but lower average damage. TU & Energy cost x2.5.{NEWLINE}>Strike. Standard melee attack, TU=13."
  STR_KATANA_UFOPEDIA: "A deadly blade, if unwieldy to carry. Requires two hands. Can break if used haphazardly, hence soldier's Strength is irrelevant."
  STR_DEATHBLADE_UFOPEDIA: "It's a blade that sends you straight to Hell. In addition to slicing and dicing, it can shoot blastwaves too. Requires VooDoo training, Summoning Circle, costs a lot of Energy and Freshness to use. Melee attacks get +60 extra Power. Vampiric (vs. Mental resist): 15% of damage dealt returned as TUs and HPs, 30% as Morale.{NEWLINE}Merely holding this evil weapon drains 4 Morale per turn."
  STR_BARBARIAN_AX_UFOPEDIA: "This two-handed ax is very heavy and quickly saps Energy, but when it hits, it leaves very little to chance."
  STR_BARDICHE_UFOPEDIA: "If your opponent is a far better speaker than yourself, ax him a question.{NEWLINE}         - Mun Tzu"
  STR_BUTCHER_CLEAVER_UFOPEDIA: "Two-handed melee weapon, wielded by large demons of the Shadowrealm."
  STR_HAMMER_UFOPEDIA: "A two handed weapon useful for cracking open walls and skulls alike through the direct application of massive blunt trauma. However this type of Hammer is more of a tool than a weapon, though, so its accuracy leaves much to be desired. Obviously requires a lot of Strength."
  STR_PICKAXE_UFOPEDIA: "Not as mighty in combat as a Hammer but not as cumbersome either. Much more efficient in hacking apart walls and other terrain features (+100% Demolition). Unreliable damage vs. moving targets."
  STR_MANACLES_UFOPEDIA: "These are useful for making sure that landlubbers who go down, stay down for good - by shackling them. They'll be workin' even against those normally immune to Stun. Useable only on prone targets. Note that some enemies WILL recover even from this, it'll only take them a lot of time."
  STR_CHAINSAW_UFOPEDIA: "Groovie."
  STR_CHAINSAW_LOLI_UFOPEDIA: "A light, sleek, fast and cute chainsaw that operates in any weather conditions - what more can a girl ask for? Especially a girl who really knows what she wants!"
  STR_CHAINSAW_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA: "A nuclear-powered industrial-grade chainsaw. It will persuade anyone to cease blocking your way. Unless that someone is made of several-inches thick plastasteel, that is."
  STR_RIPPER_UFOPEDIA: "The whirring, plastasteel teeth of this pocket-sized chainsaw inflict surrealistic wounds."
  STR_AUTO_AXE_UFOPEDIA: "Perfectly capable of going through brick walls. Yet another proof that anything can be weaponized... as if any was needed."
  STR_NOOSE_UFOPEDIA: "Some say it brings bad luck, some say they want to be extra sure the captive is properly pacified. Just don't squeeze too eagerly... if ye want 'em alive that is!"
  STR_KUSARIGAMA_UFOPEDIA: "A sickle on a chain. You can perform some pretty sick things with this one. Reactions and Throwing are the key to use it effectively. It causes extra morale and time units damage, has a range of 5 and ignores some armor. Melee attack is Cutting instead of Stabbing."
  STR_ANCHOR_UFOPEDIA: "Meant to keep boats from drifting away, it is really heavy. A sufficiently strong and determined combatant, however, can use it to pound enemies, or even swing the anchor like a flail for, potentially, some truly massive damage. Fighting in melee is possible, but less effective."
  STR_WHIP_LEATHER_UFOPEDIA: "While the damage seems unimpressive, those who take it will writhe in pain and anguish, preventing them from fighting back. The whips are also often used by some unscrupulous pirates to blow off their steam while training their hand-eye coordination by savagely whipping their fallen opponents."
  STR_WHIP_UFOPEDIA: "Lash those unwashed brutes into submission!"
  STR_FLAME_WHIP_UFOPEDIA: "Give yourself away to the flames' dance.{NEWLINE}This weapon creates fiery explosions which not only turn enemies to ashes, but also drain 33% of damage dealt as TUs. Maximum range is 5.{NEWLINE}V.Training required."
  STR_ELECTRIC_LASSO_UFOPEDIA: "Tried and true by the boys in blue. The favorite tool of Confederate slavers, it requires some skill to use properly but delivers reliable stun damage, without the risk of accidentally killing the victim. The Lasso has a max. range of 7.  High Throwing skill is required to not accidentally entangle yourself."
  STR_POISONOUS_TENTACLE_UFOPEDIA: "An exotic weapon, fashioned out of one of seas' inexhaustible bounties. Used like a whip, it can paralyze its victim with poison. Due to rarity of the poison, it fetches a good price amongst assassins. Using the tentacle is not without its pitfalls. To be kept 'alive', it has to have contact with wielders skin; this causes severe pain on every attack.{NEWLINE}On hit, the Tentacle deals Stun, TU and Morale damage, as well as some lethal damage. It ignores 25% armor."
  STR_TASER_UFOPEDIA: "Stun gun, shooting people with electric discharges. Due to small size, uses powerful electrodes and unstable, high currents, so it can, if abused, cause their death. Has a quite limited range. Contains an internal battery, good for 5 shots. Can be recharged, but often breaks down when used."
  STR_ROCK_T_UFOPEDIA: "To love, or to throw? It was the first ranged weapon ever invented. A few million years later, it is still very popular in various festivities, sports and religious observances.{NEWLINE}Melee Attack: 9 TU, Pwr = 5+STR/2"
  STR_THROWING_CARDS_UFOPEDIA: "A deck of 52 cards that a skilled magician can use to predict future or decapitate enemies.{NEWLINE}Each use improves morale of the wielder."
  STR_THROWING_STARS_UFOPEDIA: "These cute little things are quite deadly and easier to use than thrown knives. A must have for all assassin-types. A set holds 8 stars."
  STR_FUSO_KNIVES_UFOPEDIA: "Straight from the Land of the Rising Sun, they're the best-crafted throwing knives in the world, lightweight and deadly. Each set has five of these pointy things. The accuracy is low for paupers, but rises rapidly with high Throwing skill "
  STR_SUNBLADES_UFOPEDIA: "These elegant, paper-thin Plastasteel blades are made in the symbolic shape of the Sun. They cut through air and foes alike with equal ease. They're stronger and fly further than their scrap metal counterparts, but still can be impeded by thick armor due to their low weight."
  STR_LASER_STARS_UFOPEDIA: "Instead of a solid blade, these employ a forcefield, generated by a small Optronic circuit. This allows them to be both lighter and more deadly than standard Ninja Stars. The damage increase might not be major, but they also halve enemy's armor."
  STR_JAVELINS_UFOPEDIA: "A thrown weapon with an acceptable range and solid damage. When used by a strong warrior, they can easily impale a typical enemy, but they tire out really quickly."
  STR_JAVELINS_AQUA_UFOPEDIA: "Snazzy Javelins made of Aqua Plastic, which makes them more potent at piercing armor, lighter (better range) and much more expensive."
  STR_THROWING_AXES_UFOPEDIA: "Very strong and accurate thrown weapon with a somewhat limited range. Hurled with enough force, it might even cleave through some armor."
  STR_THROWING_HAMMER_UFOPEDIA: "A brutal thrown weapon, designed to break armor. Requires both hands to throw, for a proper overhead swing. Single-use."
  STR_SHREDDER_UFOPEDIA: "This heavy thrown star utilizes the power of grav modules and optronic guidance to attack at a quite long range, then return to the wielder. Its whirling blades cause bloody mayhem, and its sharp points penetrate deep into armor."
  STR_ANUS_UFOPEDIA: "A ranged stun weapon which returns to the user, therefore having effectively unlimited uses. Easy to learn, hard to master, therefore good for beginners. Maximum range of 16.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}While the weapon itself is hardly remarkable, its nature has given our Brainers quite the food for their dirty thoughts, concerning the methaphysics, the duality, the feminine element and so on and so forth. Whatever floats their boat, I guess?"
  STR_ELECTRIC_NET_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon delivers huge Stun damage, and also drains enemy Energy and TUs. It is, however, rather tricky to use.{NEWLINE}Ignores Shock Immunity. Maximum range = 12."
  STR_DAZZLING_DISC_UFOPEDIA: "This Dazzling Disc is a weird weapon that returns to the wielder after each throw. The dazing display of light is a visual effect of force that stuns the target. The disc ignores a fair amount of armor and has a max. range of 24."
  STR_PRED_DISC_UFOPEDIA: "A hyper-sharp disc that can easily slice a man in half then safely return to the wielder, thanks to built-in repulsor unit. It can change direction in flight, too. However, its maximum range is limited."
  STR_BLOWPIPE_UFOPEDIA: "A very primitive weapon, it is none the less surprisingly effective in close-quarters engagements... Once you master its usage, and blowing ain't as easy as they say. The toxic darts ignore 50% of armor and cause quad Shock damage. Does not cause Fatal Wounds. The more endurance a Gal has, the stronger this pipe becomes in her hands."
  STR_BAGPIPES_UFOPEDIA: "This strange weaponized musical instrument can spit out Celatid venom in a fashion much like what a live specimen is capable of. It also emits horrifying noises when played, much like its non-weaponized counterpart."
  STR_DEMONIC_ESSENCE_UFOPEDIA: "This flask contains what we believe is the soul of a demon. Just don't ask too many questions. The stuff is unspeakably vile so we think throwing it at an enemy will have rather sad consequences to the latter."
  STR_ZOMBIE_ESSENCE_UFOPEDIA: "This liquid, basically some form of altered blood, runs inside higher forms of Z-Phases, forming a new blood stream in place of the original, atrophied one. It seems to be very different than the green goo that fills the rest of their bodies and must be responsible for their faster metabolism and lesser Hellerium dependence, as well as their supernatural resilience."
  STR_ZOMBIE_SUSTENANCE_UFOPEDIA: "Zombie Juice is produced by some types of female Z's, just like mammals produce milk. While this makes them weaker physically, it allows them to create and sustain Zombie societal structures through sharing it, which is the key to emergence of higher evolved Z-types, like Singers."
  STR_VAMPIRE_ESSENCE_UFOPEDIA: "Beautiful and rich blood that animates vampires. It can be summarized as much purer form of the Zombie Juice. Studied closely, it almost seems like it has a mind and animation of its own. Arcanistic books about the undead speak of their three basic elements: Bone, Flesh, Spirit. Have we found here the mythical fourth element? Have we just unlocked the door to the secret of immortality?"
  STR_ZOMBIE_BRAIN_UFOPEDIA: "We extracted this brain from one of the higher forms of zombies. When dipped in Hellerium sludge, it doesn't seem to decay and keeps low level electric activity. Therefore we can keep them indefinitely... What for, is a wholly different question!"
  STR_BOW_H_UFOPEDIA: "A primitive but not so simple weapon, very popular amongst Turanian hunters. The curved shape holds surprising power and doesn't require much effort to keep drawn. High Throwing skill is the key to using it effectively. It is only ineffective at long ranges."
  STR_BOW_H_QUIVER_FIRE_UFOPEDIA: "These arrows are likely to set aflame any stuff they hit. They receive a lower bonus from the archer's Throwing skill than normal Hunting Bow arrows. However, they have higher upfront damage, and reduce enemy Morale, so even laymen can use them to some effect."
  STR_BOW_H_QUIVER_POISON_UFOPEDIA: "While these arrows do not pack high upfront damage, they're quite dependable, as they debilitate the enemy and ignore some armor."
  STR_BOW_UFOPEDIA: "It's a BOW. Made for combat. It ain't getting any simpler than that, mate."
  STR_SURVIVAL_BOW_UFOPEDIA: "It uses the same arrow types as the Combat Bow, but there the similarities end. While slower, it is more accurate, especially at long ranges. Its mechanism allows to keep it drawn with little force, which in turn allows reaction shooting. The only issue is its price tag."
  STR_BOW_QUIVER_AQUA_UFOPEDIA: "These strange arrows are used by the Deep Ones. They're much sharper than normal arrows, which results in some armor penetration. Upon closer analysis, their material appears similar to Aqua Plastics, hence we can reproduce them."
  STR_BOW_QUIVER_STUN_UFOPEDIA: "These arrows have their tips replaced with wooden weights to stun opponents without killing them. It however requires quite some skill on archer's part, and, to make it worse, such arrows are very ineffective against armored opponents."
  STR_BOW_ARROWS_HE_UFOPEDIA: "The Emporium sells these arrows at quite a premium, but the utility value might just be worth it. Explosive Arrows pack miniaturized HEAT warheads to deal with moderately-armored targets, but their area of effect is also miniaturized."
  STR_LONGBOW_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy bow for strong gals. Requires a lot of Energy to pull, but deals high damage and has a respectable range."
  STR_BOW_NEON_UFOPEDIA: "Where's the neon light coming from? It's coming from the future, baby."
  STR_XBOW_UFOPEDIA: "Well it's a bit dated design, I admit - but it penetrates armor quite well! Be careful with that g-string though, or whatever it's called. It can break yer eye. Going fast is, as always, the key."
  STR_XBOW_CORAL_UFOPEDIA: "This crossbow, used by the denizens of the depths, made from cunningly cultivated coral, lacks complex mechanisms, thus allowing for faster operation. For the same reason, shooting it costs a lot of energy, and the accuracy suffers."
  STR_TESLA_COIL_UFOPEDIA: "Fries your enemies with powerful electric discharges, how cool is that? If they don't die to massive damage, they're damned sure to go down at least. Doesn't really require aiming, but the maximum range is very limited."
  STR_CS_GAS_UFOPEDIA: "Go for their eyes! An amazing solution for boarding actions! Any target caught in the attack zone has their TUs reduced by 24-48 (assuming standard 400% smoke vulnerability), and suffers half as much Stun damage. The can is good for 2 attacks, and has an effective attack range of 4."
  STR_ZAP_GUN_UFOPEDIA: "This charming piece zaps people with electrical currents. Causes Stun instead of Health damage. Hard to replicate, it's unlikely to become a mainstay weapon, and, while boasting high accurracy, it has a very limited range and takes a noticeable moment to charge-up, thus disallowing faster re-fire rate."
  STR_OLD_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "This oldboy might not be hi-tech, but a gun is a gun. Especially if you're short on cash. Sports a single-row 9-round clip."
  STR_OLD_PISTOL_2_UFOPEDIA: "Cleaned up and returned to its former glory. Increased accuracy, especially at longer ranges."
  STR_OLD_REVOLVER_UFOPEDIA: "My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt{NEWLINE}Shoot as fast as lightnin' but she loads a mite slow{NEWLINE}Loads a mite slow, soon found out{NEWLINE}It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out.{NEWLINE}  - Traditional"
  STR_REVOLVER_POLICE_UFOPEDIA: "A well-made revolver optimized for quick firing, but with a limited long-range capacity."
  STR_REVOLVER_UFOPEDIA: "Reliable - as there isn't much that could break here. Cheap for the same reason. Six-chamber drum and an overall oldtimer feel, but the combat capacity is rather lacking."
  STR_PEACEMAKER_UFOPEDIA: "A finely crafted revolver, which only an intrepid gunslinger can use to its full capacity."
  STR_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "A little heavy for the moderate punch it provides, but has a capacity of 15 bullets and can fire them really fast, and with acceptable accuracy, even at slightly longer ranges."
  STR_PISTOL_ADV_UFOPEDIA: "Electronically-aided aiming marries pistol's inherent rate of fire with a very high accuracy. The PS ammo receives a bonus to damage for high Reactions, with the clip size increased to 22. Accurate range is increased as well."
  STR_PISTOL_LT_UFOPEDIA: "Put in yer pocket. As a last resort, blow yer brains out, but it might well take several shots."
  STR_BLACK_ADDER_UFOPEDIA: "The fastest pistol of them all. Also, the most handy one in melee combat. Uses same clips as the Holdout Pistol."
  STR_REVOLVER_LT_UFOPEDIA: "Holds surprisingly big bullets for such a tiny weapon. That still means these bullets are just less ...tiny."
  STR_SLUGGA_UFOPEDIA: "Such power for a single-handed weapon! It will be especially effective for those with huge guts. Soft lead bullets however struggle against heavy armor."
  STR_SLUGGA_MK2_UFOPEDIA: "An upgraded version of the Handcannon, this weapon is as robust as it is heavy. Heavy enough for some brawling{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 15+STR*0.25+BRA*0.25, Skill = MA, Acc = 70%, 10 TUs)"
  STR_SNUBBY_UFOPEDIA: "A compact six-shooter that packs quite a wallop - to both the target and the user. It lacks, however, in the long range department."
  STR_MAUSER_UFOPEDIA: "Almost unmatched in accuracy, thanks to its high-quality workmanship and stability gained through weight. Skilled shooters will receive a substantial bonus to damage done with this weapon."
  STR_LUGER_UFOPEDIA: "Such is the royalty of this antique pistol, that the higher ranking the shooter, the more damage she will inflict. It seems cursed, too, as it tends to be extremely deadly in the hands of certain enemies, like Humanists."
  STR_PISTOL_SILENCED_UFOPEDIA: "A small pistol with a big metal tube screwed to the front of it. Supposedly it allows the users to take advantage of their stealth when aiming for kill shots. Reactions are the key to using it well."
  STR_PISTOL_BM_UFOPEDIA: "Good balance, light weight and smooth trigger operation allow this weapon to be fired very fast in snap mode (2 rounds per autoshot) without any serious accuracy loss."
  STR_COLT45_UFOPEDIA: "High-powered and sought-after pistol. A very robust design; an elegant weapon from less barbaric times."
  STR_COMMANDO_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy pistol used by various special forces to make sure that their targets go down quickly. It has good stopping power and increased range. Carries 10 caseless, armor piercing rounds in the magazine."
  STR_HEAVY_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "Rumor is, the Confederates use these pistols to kill bears. Canadians point out that a true gentleman prefers a scoped rifle. And answers only to royalty, as opposed to a board of the wealthiest slave owners."
  STR_MAGNUM_UFOPEDIA: "This gun be deadly."
  STR_SUPER_MAGNUM_UFOPEDIA: "This pocket cannon can fire the same rounds as the Magnum, but is otherwise superior in every way."
  STR_MAGNUM_DRUM_SILVER_UFOPEDIA: "These fine Plastasteel bullets actively seek targets' weak points, which results in a much more consistent damage and gives them 20% armor penetration as well as increases final HP damage by 10%."
  STR_FLINTLOCK_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "The most commonly used firearm on Earth. Very simple and quite deadly, it often stuns whom it fails to kill, but has trouble penetrating armor.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 10+STR*0.4, Skill = MA, Acc = 70%, 9 TUs)"
  STR_FLINTLOCK_MUSKET_UFOPEDIA: "A smoothbore long arm. Heavier than a Flintlock Pistol but has better range.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.65, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 80%, 16 TUs)"
  STR_FLINTLOCK_MUSKET_B_UFOPEDIA: "Putting a solid bayonet on a Musket drastically improves performance of the weapon."
  STR_AIR_MUSKET_UFOPEDIA: "A much more accurate musket variant. It does not use gunpowder; instead, it launches projectiles with compressed air, utilizing a highly pressurized air tank. This tank will easily last throughout any engagement. This weapon works underwater.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 25+STR*0.65, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 85%, 18 TUs)"
  STR_HARQUEBUS_UFOPEDIA: "This primitive gun might not be the best at shooting things, but it has an impressive melee option."
  STR_CLOCKWORK_GUN_UFOPEDIA: "Expensive and insanely intricate, but it does deliver standard flintlock balls faster than anything else."
  STR_FLINTLOCK_BALLS_G_UFOPEDIA: "This nasty flintlock ammo releases a cloud of poisonous gas upon impact, resulting in 12-24 HP loss for unprotected targets (standard 400% Choking resistance), as well as up to half as much Stun damage. The foul gas also drains Energy and Morale.{NEWLINE}Gas Balls are too fragile to be fired from long-barreled muskets."
  STR_FLINTLOCK_BALLS_WP_UFOPEDIA: "WP means White Phosphorous. It is a chemical that burns in a high temperature, even if submerged in water. This special type of incendiary ammunition deals considerable upfront damage, while also ignoring most of enemy armor."
  STR_ZIPGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Designed to fire off the powerful Ol'Rifle rounds quickly, using lever action and a ramshackle, lighweight frame. Named after a gunsmith who was famous for similar ideas (and amazingly, did not get killed by any of his contaptions)."
  SPC_BANE_SPEAKER_UFOPEDIA: "This mask is a part of the SPEAKER outfit. It amplifies one's voice into a destructive weapon.{NEWLINE}Extra Lethal damage. Loses 1 PWR per every tile past 2.{NEWLINE}Ignores 50% armor; Damages Armor; 200% Demolition."
  STR_SUPER_STAPLER_UFOPEDIA: "This trademark tool of the Traders' Guild is a fine mechanism housed in a plastasteel chassis, perfected with just one task in mind: to staple. Takes 32-staple cartridges. Staples cause extra Morale damage and ignore some armor. As the saying goes, from the deepest ocean to the furtherst space colony, wherever the man goes, after him goes the stapling."
  STR_HAXXOR_UFOPEDIA: "The first attempt from the Sky Ninjas to break up the stranglehold of the Traders' Guild upon the arms market. It is a weirdly constructed long range weapon which uses i-Gun clips. Watch out when using it, for the Traders' Guild may sue you for the infringement on their intellectual property, ha ha har!"
  STR_IGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Also known as 'Arrr-My-Bat'ry's-Dead-Gun', it fires only in double-shot mode, while its fashion-designed battery holds 7 shots. Widely available in Traders' Guild's outlets, although the price isn't low. It's also pretty heavy, but its plasma projectiles are fairly destructive."
  STR_SHOTGUN_FIST_UFOPEDIA: "A strange contraption, designed to be an ultimate melee weapon of sorts. Firing this thing inflicts 1 point of Health damage and 10 Stun, regardless of armor; it must be worn over naked skin, because of tight leather straps. As you'd expect, range isn't exactly it's forte.{NEWLINE}Melee (Daze = STR*0.6 + MA*0.2, Skill = MA, Acc = 60%, 8 TUs)"
  STR_LASER_FIST_UFOPEDIA: "Our first shot at self-charging weaponry. The Laserfist needs no clips and is very accurate at short ranges thanks to its laser pointer, however it is rather useless at long ranges. It can also be used as a pretty effective stun weapon:{NEWLINE}Melee (Daze = STR*0.6 + MA*0.2, Skill = MA, Acc = 80%, 8 TUs)"
  STR_SAWED_OFF_UFOPEDIA: "Want a faceful of buckshot? Naw? Then surely you know someone who wants some."
  STR_SUPER_SAWED_OFF_UFOPEDIA: "A finely crafted weapon with laser sights. Quite low spread and faster reload. Can be wielded 1-handedly if you're strong enough."
  STR_DB_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Simple, thus very reliable.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.5, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 75%, 15 TUs)"
  STR_BUCKSHOT_HV_UFOPEDIA: "Used in double barreled shotguns, these shells carry heavier projectiles and expanded charges. The pellets are not only stronger, but also achieve much tighter groupings."
  STR_BUCKSHOT_NUKE_UFOPEDIA: "Nuclear explosive pellet shells for all double-barreled shotgun variants. They do not have explosive radius, but damage armor, set things on fire and have increased effectiveness vs. terrain."
  STR_SMALL_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Handy, fast and pretty accurate, but only at low ranges. Can be Infiltrated but is a two-handed weapon."
  STR_MINI_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "A miniaturized yet pretty effective shotgun, quite useful for Infiltration missions."
  STR_SHOTGUN_G_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon sure has seen ye olde days."
  STR_SHOTGUN_LT_UFOPEDIA: "Cheap is the key word. This piece of junk is quite compact, but cannot use high-powered ammo. Aimed shots are unimpressive."
  STR_SHOTGUN_POLICE_UFOPEDIA: "This type of shotgun is sleek and well-made, has a good range, but takes some time to aim properly.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.5, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 80%, 15 TUs))"
  STR_UAC_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "A classic UAC weapon. There is a rumor that original UAC Shotguns were usable in 0-G, so this one is apparently unoriginal. A hard hitting, dependable shotgun.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.65, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 80%, 16 TUs)"
  STR_SHOTGUN_PA_UFOPEDIA: "Strong and dependable, but, as you guessed it, heavy. Holds 8 rounds. Very slow to reload.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.6, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 80%, 16 TUs)"
  STR_SHOTGUN_PA_SLUGS_AP_UFOPEDIA: "These slugs for the Heavy Shotgun are meant to break through armor and they indeed deliver a hell of a kick. They are, however, not easy to come by. Rumor is, Gun Emporium has these on sale."
  STR_OGRE_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "A big ol' boomstick, dispensing heavy pellets with unmatched generosity. Just watch your encumbrance.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 30+STR*0.7, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 75%, 20 TUs)"
  STR_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "A good, semi-automatic weapon for short-range firefights. Better range than with standard shotguns. However, magazine holds only 6 shells."
  STR_SHOTGUN_ADV_UFOPEDIA: "A pimped-up version of the Military Shotgun."
  STR_SHOTGUN_SHELLS_NUKE_UFOPEDIA: "Nuclear shells in standard shotgun format. They do not have explosive radius, but damage armor, set things on fire and have increased effectiveness vs. terrain. They can be fired from Police or Smart Shotguns."
  STR_ASG12_UFOPEDIA: "Fires a lot of low-powered pellets, quickly dispatching unarmored targets. Warning: rubber shot can be lethal.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.5, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 80%, 15 TUs)"
  STR_COMBAT_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Carrying more ammo and firing less numerous but more massive pellets, the gun is considered by some to be worth the extra encumbrance - especially since it can fire in bursts.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.6, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 80%, 16 TUs)"
  STR_COMBAT_SHOTGUN_B_UFOPEDIA: "There is an old tale of a wee mystic from northwestern Blackmarch who fought off a whole Humanist Pogrom using nothing but a gun like this one. Uses standard Combat Shotgun ammo, is equipped with a stabby implement."

  STR_BLUNDERBUSS_ADV_UFOPEDIA: "We took what's best and got rid of the rest. Time is money, and the Golden ammo will favor those who have a lot of it, while taking it away from anyone it hits."
  STR_SLUGTHROWER_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon fires air-propelled missiles that work both underwater and on the surface. To make sure that when you want someone gone, they're gone. The massive impact of its slug ammo crushes armor and deals severe Shock."
  STR_SUPER_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "A true piece of art. Exceptional range for a shotgun."
  STR_MAMMOTH_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "A belt-fed death machine of black steel, a blend between a shotgun and a minigun. Its internal stabilization allows you to throw an unprecedented amount of hot lead at your enemies with relative precision."

  STR_RIFLE_ADV_UFOPEDIA: "This type of of 6.5mm caseless assault rifle was developed in the XXIst century, but high unit cost made them unpopular. Nowadays they're a very rare animal. We can, however, with proper skills, bring them back from the dead."

  STR_RIFLE_LT_UFOPEDIA: "Its purpose is to deliver rifle bullets to far-off targets. It is adequate in that capacity, but don't expect anything more."
  STR_RIFLE_SA80_UFOPEDIA: "This design allows for easier handling in Auto and Snap modes, but decreases long range accuracy. Uses the ubiquitous RCF Carbine clips, but the magazines have a tendency to fall off if not carefully secured.{NEWLINE}Slow Reload (20); Less 1-H Penalty (35%)"
  STR_RUGER_UFOPEDIA: "Even a beginner will have no trouble handling this weapon. Uses the same magazines as the RCF Carbine. Good Snap Shot range.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.5, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 70%, 15 TUs)"
  STR_INFANTRY_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A semi-automatic classic equipped with them good ol' iron sights. So good, actually, that they increase accurate Snap Shot range to 18. The name comes from the fact that most militaries see no reason to pay for better rifles to arm their footmen.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.6, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 80%, 16 TUs)"
  STR_BATTLE_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A heavier variant of the standard modern rifle. Powerful and accurate at long ranges, but has a hell of a kick that impedes autofire accuracy. Has a fancy plastic ammo clip, too.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.5, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 80%, 15 TUs)"

  STR_UAC_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A weird rifle design that sends three bullets instead of one, almost instantaneously, any time the trigger is pressed. Tends to be quite deadly if it hits, which makes it well-liked across the world.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 20+STR*0.5, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 75%, 15 TUs)"
  STR_UAC_CLIP_AQUA_UFOPEDIA: "Aqua ammunition for UAC Rifle. Ignores half of enemy's armor, has tighter spread and also is lighter, which increases clip size."

  STR_SMG_10MM_UFOPEDIA: "A bit cumbersome, but well-made, SMG, firing powerful 10mm caseless ammo stored in 32-round magazines. Well-liked by urban warriors all over the globe and widely exported."
  STR_PPSH_UFOPEDIA: "So, after getting some knowledge about firearms, we have made our own 'linux' SMG, which means custom, ramshackle and home-made. It ain't a Boarding Gun but has some good kick and decent range for a bullet-spewer."
  STR_PPSH_3_UFOPEDIA: "This version of the Linux has been fitted with clever laser-pointer bitz, thus increasing some accuracies and decreasing aiming time. Accurate ranges are increased by 2, too."
  STR_PPSH_4_UFOPEDIA: "Even better than the last, the Origami Linux is gyro-stabilized for better autofire accuracy and rate of fire. Also, we've fitted a shock device into its butt, increasing stun power of its melee attacks by 15, while halving lethality."

  STR_KRUGER_UFOPEDIA: "This ramshackle handgun is of Earth origin, even if the inspiration and parts likely aren't. Accuracy isn't its forte, but it was built for characters who only shoot from point-blank distance, and preferably only once - the damage it deals is quite fearsome."
  STR_MPG_UFOPEDIA: "Ugly as hell and infernally inaccurate, this human-made lightweight plasma weapon has some kind of charm none the less. Probably due to its impressive firepower."
  STR_HEAT_RAY_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "Turns people to steaming slag through the application of the steamy love of an infrared heating beam. Very accurate up-close but does lose focus over distance."
  STR_RAYGUN_UFOPEDIA: "We commandeered a Raygun while we were escaping. It is a powerful weapon that can easily evaporate a landlubber, but finding ammo might be a lil' problem."
  STR_SONIC_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "A weird but stupendously powerful weapon of the depths that uses the destructive force of pure tone, just like that trick with breaking glass with voice, only much nastier.

  STR_LYNX_UFOPEDIA: "A rare collector's weapon. Fires Skorpion's ammo at astounding rates, at the price of reduced accurate range."
  STR_LAWGIVER_UFOPEDIA: "A very finely made pistol with great accuracy. It fires armor-piercing ammo. However, its effective range is somewhat low. High Bravery and Reactions both increase the damage it inflicts.{NEWLINE}Uses Sat Uplink, thus suffering only a half of the normal no-LoS penalty."

  STR_DEATH_BLOSSOM_UFOPEDIA: "A very heavy, one-handed killing machine. Better than any comparable handgun, as long as you're strong enough to wield it."
  STR_COMMANDO_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A perfect tool of a patient hunter, with enough power to pierce an armored hide and accuracy to deliver where it counts, all in a relatively compact package. The target-tracking sights allow for exceptionally deadly reaction shooting."
  STR_OLD_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Reliable and accurate, but slow to fire. Its bullets ignore 10% of enemy's armor. Ammo is quite commonly available, but almost nobody wants to part with such a rifle.

  STR_DRAGOON_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A sturdy, high-powered rifle, often used by dragoons, as the name implies, since it is too heavy for infantry to carry around easily.

  STR_CHAINGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Not to be confused with a machine gun, it lacks long-range accuracy and should be rather considered an SMG-equivalent for those strong enough to wield it. Damages armor."
  STR_UAC_HEAVY_NAILGUN_UFOPEDIA: "This quad-barreled weapon seemed impossible, as we could not locate its energy source, much less activate it. But that was until we've found out about UAC's transdimensional experiments. Yes, it seems to be drawing energy from another dimension. The unique nature of its ammunition also indicates that it was designed to fight otherworldly creatures. {NEWLINE}Poor accuracy at long ranges. Damages armor."
  STR_ROTOGUN_UFOPEDIA: "An inaccurate weapon that can, none the less, generate an impressive volume of fire. It is also primitive enough to be constructed in an Extractor. Not very effective against heavy armor."

  AUX_WOLVERIN_WEAPON_ELECTRIFIER_UFOPEDIA: "Engages enemies with debilitating EMP discharges which inflict sizeable Stun damage and disrupt reactions. Deadly to EMP-vulnerable targets. Effective range is quite limited, though (12). Past that, it quickly starts losing accuracy and power. It's also quite ornery: every use causes 5 Stun damage to the pilot."
  AUX_WOLVERIN_WEAPON_RPG_UFOPEDIA: "This launcher can fire RPG rounds with high accuracy and fire rate."
  AUX_MECHA_GRABBER_UFOPEDIA: "A standard issue, Mecha Suit, multipurpose grabber. Its mechanical tentacle gives it a range of 5. Effective at clearing passages and tearning off enemy's armor."

No gas mask protects against it. I guess Zombies and Chryssalids should fear it even more, but sadly they're incapable of that emotion."
  STR_AC_AQUA_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "This type of Auto Cannon ammo fires three Aqua Plastic needles instead of a single solid projectile. The needles strike in a tight grouping and ignore 50% of enemy's armor."
  STR_MEGA_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "The basic assault weapon of the Mobile Infantry, it fires big high-explosive shells that ignore 20% of target's armor."
  STR_MEGA_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "This deadly laser weapon fires volleys of extremely powerful blasts to decimate the enemy."
  STR_MEGA_FLAMER_UFOPEDIA: "Launches streams of superheated flame (triple damage) up to a very considerable range. The fire is so hot that it damages terrain and items."
  STR_BALLISTA_UFOPEDIA: "Looks like an x-bow, mean like a cannon, works like a bow. What the hell is it?{NEWLINE}Accuracy x2 when kneeling; 25 Energy/Shot"
  STR_KRAKEN_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "Instead of using gunpowder, this marvel of engineering lobs cannonballs with its powerful mechanical tentacles. It functions underwater. It also has a mind of its own, and quickly reloads itself with anything it can find on wielder's person. Sometimes in a less-than-gentle manner; every use inflicts 6 Stun dmg."
  STR_PIR_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "Few things in life beat decapitating someone with a cannonball. The cast-iron cannonballs hit with a massive impact and make a mockery of light armor, but do not explode.{NEWLINE}GunButt (Daze = 25+STR*0.65, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 75%, 18 TUs, Extra Lethal)"
  STR_PIR_CANNONBALL_INC_UFOPEDIA: "This cannonball has low power, but maximum blast radius. It goes up with a very loud bang, causing some stun, time units and morale damage, and can start many fires.{NEWLINE}Special: Shock x2, Incendiary"

  STR_PIR_CANNONBALL_GAS_UFOPEDIA: "This cannonball sprays its hapless victims with poisonous gas, within a 5 tile range. It is less lethal than commercially available poison gas grenades, but deals more stun damage."
  STR_PIR_CANNONBALL_SC_UFOPEDIA: "Instead of relying on chemicals, this explosive device uses Superconductive Wire to store the energy. It can be fired from an Assault Cannon; any other weapon would probably have too high exit velocity and the projectile would shatter upon firing. In addition to causing more devastation than a standard Cannonball, this one also causes thrice as much extra Stun damage (ignoring Shock Immunity), but only half damage to Items."
  STR_HGL_UFOPEDIA: "The heavy grenade launcher uses the same grade of ammunition as the normal one, but loaded in packs of 6. What it lacks in finesse, it makes up in firing rate."
  STR_GRENADE_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "Lobs grenades over distances impossible to achieve by throwing. The grenades come in three sorts, and detonate on impact. Skill and patience is needed to use this weapon in an accurate manner.{NEWLINE}Accuracy x1.5 when kneeling; -1/3 no-LoS acc. penalty."
  STR_GL_FAE_UFOPEDIA: "Black Napalm is an incendiary agent spiked with Hellerium. It features a very large blast and extra HP damage, all in a small package."

  STR_AGL_UFOPEDIA: "Doctor Wang's Express Pain Delivery System reaches far out into the battlefield and its 8-round magazine makes sure the party never stops. Sometimes, distance is just a number."
  STR_TTGL_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy grenade launcher with extended range. The trajectory prediction computer cuts the no-LoS penalty by half, but to fully utilize it, the shooter needs to steady herself and focus (Accuracy x1.75 when kneeling)."
  STR_BLIZZARD_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "A single-handed short range rocket launcher. Can launch all six rockets at once, but it's anyone's guess where they'll end up."
  STR_MORTAR_UFOPEDIA: "Prolonged sieges being your thing? Brutally simple and tested in countless wars, the Mortar is going to do all the work for you. Just seize a good position, sit back and enjoy the fireworks.{NEWLINE}Accuracy x3 when kneeling.{NEWLINE}Halved no-LoS acc. penalty."

  STR_HAND_MORTAR_UFOPEDIA: "Hand Mortar is not a weapon made for mere mortals. The shock of discharge alone deals 20 Stun damage to the user. It is likely the biggest pistol in the world. Also has a strong melee attack."
  STR_MORTAR_SHELL_GAS_UFOPEDIA: "A poisonous gas shell for the Mortar. A simple and clean solution to the problem of numerical superiority. Has a huge radius of effect (13)."
  STR_MORTAR_SHELL_NUKE_UFOPEDIA: "A Hellerium explosive shell for the Mortar."
  STR_MORTAR_SHELL_FUSION_UFOPEDIA: "A Fusion explosive shell for the Mortar."

  STR_3RL_UFOPEDIA: "A half-portable terrain remodelling kit. Holds three rounds. Perfect for all your heavy support needs.{NEWLINE}Halved no-LoS acc. penalty."
  STR_RPG_UFOPEDIA: "Portable and affordable, this humble weapon puts the capability to engage heavily armored targets into the hands of a common man. The DP shells have a larger blast and demolition power, while the HEAT ones pierce armor better."
  STR_SMALL_ROCKET_NUKE_UFOPEDIA: "No special effects, just a concentrated Hellerium blast for the win."
  STR_SMALL_ROCKET_NUKE_QUAD_UFOPEDIA: "Four times the destruction of a Hellerium RPG round."
  STR_RPG_ADV_UFOPEDIA: "This fancy launcher is known for its homing Hellfire rounds which ignore half of target's armor."
  STR_RECOILLESS_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "The R-Rifle fires heavy armor piercing shells."

  STR_FUSION_ROCKET_UFOPEDIA: "Fusion-warhead-equipped rocked for maximum F-Force."
  STR_GAS_ROCKET_UFOPEDIA: "A rocket with a potent poisonous gas warhead. Anything unprotected within its blast area (13) is most likely to breath its last."
  STR_TOXIGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Sprays unfortunates with a toxic solution of the most vile kind. Small tank size and lousy accuracy, though."
  STR_CANISTER_GUN_UFOPEDIA: "A medium-range terror weapon, digitally set to explode in any 'unauthorized' hands. It launches capsules with extra-deadly chemic load, enough to liquify a human in seconds with a direct hit. Both ammo types damage armor."
  STR_FIREBALL_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This nuclear-powered old Arena favorite appeals to everyone's inner pyromaniac. As it never runs out of juice, turning battlefields into seas of flames has never been easier!"
  STR_RAIL_DRIVER_UFOPEDIA: "A mining tool, used to drive superhardened spikes deep into the rock, it can pretty easily drive them into your enemies as well. Used as a weapon, it's rather cumbersome though."
  STR_UAC_ROCKET_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This advanced weapon shoots fast and accurately. It's small rockets, have plastic warheads which do not only ignore 20% armor, but also damage it. A magazine holds 5 rounds, and reloading goes quite swiftly. Its main drawback is low accuracy at long ranges."
  STR_QUAD_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "You want some Wang? Wanton destruction is on its way!"
  STR_RED_DRAGON_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "'Just like Hiroshima'{NEWLINE}    - Dr. Wang{NEWLINE}This weapon is especially favored by Lo Wang, called by some God of Death, or the Red Dragon of the East. He lets you have it in appreciation of the Path of Blood you have chosen. Beware of the immense blast radius."

  STR_SSRL_UFOPEDIA: "A single-shot, discardable anti-tank missile launcher with a huge, unwieldy warhead. But just look at the damage. It's a lot of mullah for a bang, but sometimes you just need that little extra oomph. Ignores 25% of target's armor (instead of normal 40% as better-made HEAT warheads do). Warning: effective range is very limited."
  STR_SSRL_2_UFOPEDIA: "Launcher, Assault, Single Shot. A compact and lightweight weapon, for these moments when nothing else would really do. It delivers a decent punch with 25% armor penetration, just enough to get rid of that brick wall or a pesky armored car. Not recommended against real tanks."
  STR_HARPOON_UFOPEDIA: "Launches high-impact projectiles for either killing or capturing people with extreme prejudice, depending on ammunition loaded. The weapon however has only a three round clip."
  STR_HARPOON_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: "A three-barreled version of Harpoon Gun, designed for higher intensity underwater combat. It also allows for faster reload."
  STR_HARPOON_AUTO_UFOPEDIA: "This underwater-capable gun fires Aqua Plastic bolts, which are not only lighter than normal, but also reduce enemy armor by 20% (all ammo types)."
  STR_DART_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "There are tranquilizers so potent that a mere drop can stun a horse (or any other mythical creature), so such a weapon would be extremely effective - if we had such tranquilizers. Somehow though, the weapon is very popular amongst the brainy types, since its basic ammo stuns and disrupts reactions."
  STR_LIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "A convenient tool to set something on fire. Internal tank holds 5 charges. Refillable, but people often don't bother to do so.{NEWLINE}Special: Reactions Disrupt (x1){NEWLINE}Limited range (3)."
  STR_FLAMETHROWER_UFOPEDIA: "It's a flamethrower. It throws flames. Powerful, ignores low obstacles, but has a limited range (9).{NEWLINE}Special: Reactions Disrupt (x1)"
  STR_HAND_FLAMER_UFOPEDIA: "As the name implies, it can set your hands aflame. The Church of Sirius uses it for 'gardening' purposes. Has a very limited range (5).{NEWLINE}Special: Reactions Disrupt (x1)"
  STR_FLAMETHROWER_LR_UFOPEDIA: "Difficult in operation, but allows you to throw some flames up to 20 tiles away.{NEWLINE}Special: Reactions Disrupt (x1)"
  STR_FLAMETHROWER_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "A tank of highly flammable liquid, used in flamethrowers, tools and vehicles."
  STR_HEAVY_FLAMER_UFOPEDIA: "A perfect tool for spreading chaos and mayhem. Has much better range (15) and area coverage than the standard flamethrower, but the ammo supply is limited to 4 uses per tank.{NEWLINE}Special: Reactions Disrupt (x1)"
  AUX_LNG_UFOPEDIA: "An improvised weapon of a space pod, normally used to put out the fires. The super-cold liquid it launches deals lethal as well as stun damage, and drastically reduces the TUs of the attacked foe."
  AUX_BIOSUIT_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "Each use of this weapon costs 9 Stamina and 3 Health. It launches a smoke cloud that quickly eats away armor and obstacles. Ignores 2/3 of enemy armor, causes lethal damage, double Shock damage and drains Reactions (x3); it doesn't cause Fatal Wounds.{NEWLINE}Has an effective range of 15, and loses 5 POWER per each tile after that. Hitting enemies with it trains Bravery and Reactions."
  STR_IRRADIATOR_UFOPEDIA: "Irradiates the target with hard gamma rays. Low overall power but great armor penetration (-75%). In addition to normal damage, it drains target's Energy and disrupts their movement. A weird side-effect is removal of Stun damage. Loses some power at ranges above 15 tiles.{NEWLINE}Reactions Disrupt (x3); Energy Drain (x6)"
  STR_COOKER_UFOPEDIA: "An extremely powerful, if short-ranged weapon that melts the target by exciting its molecules with EM waves. Can breach through even reinforced plastasteel. Loses some power at ranges above 5 tiles.{NEWLINE}Shock x2, ignores Shock Immunity"
  STR_LIGHTNING_THROWER_UFOPEDIA: "A power of the ancient gods; it hurls a deadly thunderball at enemies. Those without high Electricity resistance become but charred remains when hit by this. Loses some power at ranges above 15 tiles.{NEWLINE}Shock x3, ignores Shock Immunity; Demolition -50%"
  STR_LASER_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: "A cheap solution to the problem of a nuclear laser rifle, this gun is somewhat underpowered but also very light - it can be easily used even by the weakest Runts!"
  STR_LASER_SUPERCHARGER_UFOPEDIA: "A reliable, if a bit experimental, laser weapon that never runs out of power. The beam can be refocused into a plasma bayonet with the following stats:{NEWLINE}Accuracy 125%, TU Cost 14{NEWLINE}Skill: MELEE/2 + 50{NEWLINE}POWER: 45 + MELEE*0.3{NEWLINE}DAMAGE type: PLASMA"
  STR_LASER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Accurate and powerful, this laser is an ideal standard-issue weapon. It won't ever run out of ammo either, so, instead of puny beam-counting, your precious mind can better focus on doing great deeds, Cap'n!"
  STR_MP_LASCANNON_UFOPEDIA: "An improved (ie bigger) version of a Heavy Laser; so big it has to be shoulder-mounted, but it easily blasts through even the heaviest armor: the Lascannon has improved armor-piercing effectiveness.{NEWLINE}Special: Accuracy x2 when kneeling."
  STR_FUSION_TORCH_UFOPEDIA: "This is an expensive, nuclear-powered tool used to cut and weld thick plastasteel plates in shipwrighting and other construction. While your hands are not very likely to become master welders, cutting a man-sized hole in just about anything (including man-sized targets) is easier done than said."
  STR_FIRE_EXT_UFOPEDIA: "Used to put out people who are on fire. Be careful, it's not harmless and causes up to 32 Stun & TUs damage (assuming standard 400% smoke vulnerability).{NEWLINE}It can also be used to whack opponents senseless (Stun = 20+STR*0.6, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 65%, 16 TUs, high secondary lethal damage){NEWLINE}Limited Range (6)"
  STR_FOAM_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Instantly puts out the fires, and raises a smoke cover! Deals some TU and Stun damage as well! Incredible!{NEWLINE}Warning: shock-resistant. Needs to be thrown to the ground forcefully."
  STR_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Light and convenient tool for exploding people. Results not guaranteed when used for demolition or against modern body armor, but it can be thrown pretty far. Like most grenades, explodes at the end of the turn it has been primed."
  STR_STICK_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "No timer, no hassle, just pull the pin and throw. The ingenious stick device assures it can be thrown pretty far even by weak people.{NEWLINE}Max Range: 22."
  STR_GRENADE_FRAG_UFOPEDIA: "A strong explosive charge, contained within a fragmentating metal shell. It brings more violence to your doorstep than a HE grenade, but weighs more."
  STR_GRENADE_FRAG_PS_UFOPEDIA: "A simple but powerful grenade developed by Marsec, primarly to engage shielded targets. It has a Hellerium core and a shell made of super-sharp Plastasteel plating, that fragments on explosion and cuts down foes like wheat.{NEWLINE}Decreased blast dropoff (50%); Damages Armor; Sets Fire; Damages Morale{NEWLINE}Demolition -33%; Enemy Armor +25%"
  STR_GRENADE_FUSION_UFOPEDIA: "Our own version of a vanilla Hellerium Grenade, stronger and heavier than the tiny original, and with no stupid code-locks."
  STR_DYNAMITE_UFOPEDIA: "Dynamite. Dyna-mite. A home-made high explosive, for those special situations where you absolutely, positively need something blown to kingdom come. Can't be thrown as far as a grenade, so make sure you put it into worthy hands.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 75%; Demolition +50%"
  STR_EMP_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "A devious explosive device that emits a strong electromagnetic pulse upon exploding. It will fry any robot extra crispy. It even affects people in fancy powered suits.{NEWLINE}Ignores 3/4 of enemy armor.{NEWLINE}Shock x6; Does NOT Ignore Shock Resistance.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 80%"
  STR_RIOT_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy, thrown explosive used by Military Police. Its primary function is to stun and confuse victims, but it is known for being often quite lethal. Its explosion is very spectacular to watch, though.{NEWLINE}Instantly explodes on impact; can be held in inventory safely{NEWLINE}Special: Reactions Disrupt (x1.5); Extra Damage (Lethal): 75%"
  STR_STICK_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "A primitive, yet fairly effective and quick to use anti-armor weapon. It has a blast radius of only 2 tiles, so aim well.{NEWLINE}Instantly explodes on impact; can be held in inventory safely{NEWLINE}Special: Ignores 35% of enemy armor.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}In a bind, the Stick Bomb can be used as an impromptu melee weapon (Daze damage), but this requires some skill and is rather very painful to the recipient."
  STR_STUN_GRENADE_PIR_UFOPEDIA: "It makes a bang loud enough to likely stun an unarmored human target. Even if the target is not downed, any Stun damage it took translates into Time Units loss, suppressing Reaction Fire.{NEWLINE}Special: Armor +50%; Reactions Disrupt (x1.5)"
  STR_STASIS_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "This grenade is quite useful for live captures, causing Stun damage unaffected by armor (but affected by Daze Resistance). It also immediately heals up to 18 HP, but damages Freshess a lot. Does not explode in inventory.{NEWLINE}Stun damage x1.25"
  STR_WP_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Burn baby burn, flames are getting higher! Causes very intense incineration within a limited radius (3); unlike normal fire weapons, WP causes high initial damage to the target, and can destroy fragile items. Other WP shells work in a similar fashion."
  STR_CRY_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "A deadly cloud of special chemical agent, which supercharges hellerium-based metabolism, causing targets' own Hellerium to fry it from inside. The most vulnerable targets, like Chryssalids, instantly go up in flames and explode. Well, of course the agent is harmless to those who do not have this kind of biochemistry, like Purebloods. The explosion radius is 5."
  STR_GAS_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "This grenade releases a cloud of poisonous gas in a 4-tile radius. It can cause 30-60 Health damage to an unprotected, humanlike target, which usually leads to a gruesome death."
  STR_ACID_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "A type of grenade that sprays everything with highly corrosive acid. Highly damaging to terrain and items, living targets are usually mobile enough to avoid the majority of the splash, but they still will lose extra 4-12 points of armor, and the intense pain may cause them to faint.{NEWLINE}Special: Extra Damage (Stun: 25%, Items: 50%, Demolition: 100%)"
  STR_GRENADE_BUG_UFOPEDIA: "This small and vicious bugger is actually a bioweapon. When excited in a certain way, it explodes in a cloud of plague spores, infecting the targets with a deadly disease. It is all the more dangerous, as it ignores all known forms of defense except for natural resistance and sufficiently thick Bottom armor.{NEWLINE}The biological nature of this grenade comes with perks: it has a mind of its own, thus increasing base accuracy and reducing no-LoS inaccuracy. It is fast to prime, however, it cannot be unprimed, so be careful when exciting it..."
  STR_MOLOTOV_UFOPEDIA: "Fire and forget, but don't forget to light it up before throwing (a common swabbie mistake). It's not a grenade!{NEWLINE}Special: Reactions Disrupt (x1){NEWLINE}Max Range: 20."

  STR_SPIKEBALL_UFOPEDIA: "Lo Wang's Bang.{NEWLINE}Max Range: 12."
  STR_BOOM_FRUIT_UFOPEDIA: "These dangerous fruits can be found in Zones, particularly Steel Forests. They explode when violently shaken (or bitten). Looks like the plant uses the explosion to spread its spores, and maybe create some fertilizer from the unwary as an added bonus.{NEWLINE}Max Range: 24."
  STR_FLASK_ACID_UFOPEDIA: "Single-use, easily breakable glass object containing a highly reactive substance. Do not ingest. Seriously.{NEWLINE}Max Range: 16.{NEWLINE}Special: Instant Armor Damage (0-25)"
  STR_SCROLL_PINK_UFOPEDIA: "An arcane scroll, filled with unspeakably lewd runes and giving out a warm, tingling aura. When the caster reads it (V.Training required), a powerful area-effect spell is discharged. It causes heavy Morale damage and destroys armor. Only resistance to Charm damage helps, so the caster should plan her outfit accordingly, as the blast is centered on her. Each casting costs 36 Energy & Morale."
  STR_BONE_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "This shield has a power to drain enemy's Morale and Time, hitting without fail inside its range of 12. It inflicts some armor damage, too. In addition, it reduces Piercing, Daze, Cutting and Mind damage taken by the wielder by 1/3 (up to max resistance of 30%)."
  STR_PLANT_X_UFOPEDIA: "This plant is a weapon that shoots out tentacles that devour the enemy. It returns 50% of damage inflicted as HP to the wielder, but drains her Energy 1.5x of that amount. It has a difficult time penetrating armor, but if it does, it causes severe armor damage. Weapon's maximum range is 9."
  AUX_SKULL_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "This is a part of Purgatoria armor. It can be used for (rather deadly) shield bashing, which also damages armor (Concussive damage). It also can shoot a ray of pure dread up to a range of 20; it drains enemy TUs and Morale."
  STR_BOOM_KEG_UFOPEDIA: "By the power of five Boom Fruits combined, we summon the Boom Keg!{NEWLINE}WARNING: It cannot be unprimed, so better not summon it without a good reason!{NEWLINE}Increased blast dropoff (120%).{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 65%"
  STR_SATCHEL_CHARGE_UFOPEDIA: "A satchel filled with high explosives. Used by peaceful folks for mining, demolition and mass carnage purposes. Danger: huge explosion radius. Damages armor. Unlike grenades, it can be effectively used underwater.{NEWLINE}Decreased blast dropoff (75%).{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 50%"
  STR_BARREL_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "A barrel filled with explosives. Lacks concentrated power to break the hardest walls, but second to none in mass demolition due to its extended blast radius (25).{NEWLINE}Decreased blast dropoff (60%); Penalty vs. Armor (+25%). {NEWLINE}Accuracy: 35%"
  STR_INCENDIARY_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Similar to Molotovs but equipped with a timer and a more powerful charge. It only deals standard fire damage, but has a nasty effect on enemy Morale."
  STR_FIREBOMB_UFOPEDIA: "A powerful explosive device that coats everything within a huge radius with burning napalm. Good for preliminary clearing of large ships and buildings, as it has a devastating morale effect and doesn't evaporate the loot.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 65%"
  STR_GAS_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "A dreadful weapon, perfect for clearing buildings and crafts from all life in a clean, silent and non-smelly manner. Can cause 45-90 lethal damage to a normal target, and the damage remains constant across the whole effective radius (10).{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 65%"
  STR_KNOCKOUT_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "A bigger version of the Knockout Grenade. It has a much wider explosion radius (10), spreads the gas more evenly and is stronger (sometimes, sadly, a bit too strong, even).{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 65%"
  STR_COV_UFOPEDIA: "Very unwieldy to throw, but still goes a long way. Literally: the shrapnel remains dangerous in a far wider area than you'd think. Blast radius is 9 tiles, and the Crate still inflicts half of its damage at blast's edge.{NEWLINE}Special: Extra Fire Damage; Double Damage Radius; Armor Damage{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 40%"
  STR_SOL_DEMO_CHARGE_UFOPEDIA: "A type of Hellerium mine used in Hellerium mining. How ironic.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 65%; Demolition +33%"

  STR_BARREL_NUKE_UFOPEDIA: "This is an explosive device, combining the power of three Baby Nukes. Properly rigging the nukes to explode simultaneously and not destroy each other was a major obstacle. But now we have a devastating weapon with a blast radius that covers more than a city block.{NEWLINE}Warning: for no logical reason whatsoever, armed Baby Nukes are very dangerous in use. We think they're cursed. Disarming them takes a whole turn.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 35%"
  STR_BABY_NUKE_TIMED_UFOPEDIA: "A Baby Nuke with a timed detonator affixed to it.{NEWLINE}Warning: for no logical reason whatsoever, armed Baby Nukes are very dangerous in use. We think they're cursed. Disarming them takes a whole turn.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 50%"
  STR_MINE_UFOPEDIA: "As the old saying goes, few things can sneak up to someone as good as a landmine. This time-honored and ever-popular device of war has a proximity fuse that will detonate as soon as something enters a 1 meter circle around it (note that it can't detect movement above or below it). The force of the explosion is concentrated upwards, so the blast is contained within a 2-meter radius. Just like a DP warhead, it ignores 20% of target's armor. A mine can be destroyed by any explosive attack of 80 Power, including another mine, so be careful and space them out.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 50%"
  STR_MINE_N_UFOPEDIA: "This mine has been laced with Hellerium, and a special fuse has been developed to make it explode. Dirty and inefficient, but effective design. The explosion is much more powerful, so the kill radius stretches to 4 tiles. N-Mine is destroyed by 100+ damage.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 50%"
  STR_MUMBLEBALL_UFOPEDIA: "A handy device, designed to alert you about approaching foes. Leaves a puff of smoke (so you can remember where it went off), and emits an audio signal, voiced by a Latin cult B-Movie star of a slightly faded glory, Bendejo himself. These sounds can have disconcerting effects on passerbys who activate the Mumbleball (TU and Morale damage). To activate, just throw it forcefully to wake Bendejo up. Needs no priming."
  STR_KNOCKOUT_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Works exactly like a Smoke Grenade, with a twist - it's filled with a drugged gas, that delivers about quadruple Stun damage to those who are hit by the initial explosion. No more dangerous than a standard smoke after that. It won't have any effect on enemies who are immune to smoke."
  STR_HALLUCINOGEN_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Contains a package of a very funny gas that can cause all sorts of visions. Potent enough to punch through weak gas masks. Can be used either recreationally or to capture people."
  STR_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: "With the power to blow most buildings to kingdom come, occupants included, this handheld problem solver is sometimes named 'a perfect gift for a girl who has everything'. It is even provided with a sophisticated, unerring timer (which, as research shows, is almost never used). It wasn't designed as a thrown weapon, though, so high Strength is a must if you plan to use it offensively, Cap'n.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 65%; Demolition +25%"
  STR_PROXIMITY_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "A Hellerium explosive of our own design, it is fitted with a crystal-based proximity fuse. Powerful yet lightweight. It has a blast radius of 3 metres. Unlike mines, it has a tracking device and thus is visible on the Minimap."
  STR_SMOKE_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Smoke grenades are useful for providing cover in exposed combat situations. Use with care because they can benefit the enemy as well."
  STR_ELECTRO_FLARE_UFOPEDIA: "This 'light-gem' as unenlightened call it, powered by a practically inexhaustible energy source, produces bright light. When used in night time combat, it will highlight enemy units (as well as your own). To activate, just throw it on the ground; and it can be thrown really far.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 75%; 15% chance to break on impact"
  STR_MOTION_SCANNER_UFOPEDIA: "This tricky device's function is to detect moving enemy units. However, it requires some practice to use effectively. Activate it by clicking 'Aye?'. The display shows an arrow in the center which is the direction your gal is facing (North is at the top). The flashing blobs show units which have moved recently.

  STR_CANTEEN_UFOPEDIA: "Contains clean, irradiated water for refreshment. Good for 12 uses per battle, each restoring 20 Stun Damage. Can be manufactured at any Hideout that has an Extractor."
  STR_CANTEEN_WEED_UFOPEDIA: "An improved version of the basic Canteen. Good for 12 uses per battle, each restoring 25 Stun Damage, which might not feel like a great improvement, but the user also gains 10 Morale per use. Thus, the market value of this beverage is quite substantial. Can be manufactured at any Hideout that has both Still and Extractor."
  STR_KALTES_KLARES_UFOPEDIA: "This luxury product is based on crystal clean water for human consumption, enriched with active water memory engrams and probiotic molecules for rejuvenation. Makes your skin smooth and your eyes big and mysterious. Alcohol-free, meat-free, sugar-free but definitely NOT free. It can keep a whole team awake for a week. Each use removes 10 Stun damage and restores 15 Energy, but costs 10 Morale. 5 doses. Side effects might or might not include twitching. Can only be used on oneself."
  STR_BEER_UFOPEDIA: "Tastes like piss but possesses a pretty solid kick due to being slightly irradiated. Quickly downing it restores 20 Energy and 4 Stun damage, but causes 1 Freshness damage. Good for 3 uses."
  STR_MOONSHINE_UFOPEDIA: "Crude alcohol we can produce at our Still. Potent enough to give a buzz. Each sip replenishes 25 Energy but causes 3 Freshness damage (and restores 5 Morale to the user). 4 charges per bottle."
  STR_VODKA_UFOPEDIA: "A luxury brand of a very strong human beverage, 330 Proof (Hellerium-boosted). Brewed on third-grade depleted Hellerium, collected from old spaceport conduits and landing platforms. Not very popular outside of human cities, as mutants generally prefer the taste of much cheaper rye and potato vodka. Kosmoportovaya allows you to quickly kill off the pain caused by injury and disinfect the wound, thereby stopping further health loss. It doesn't replenish your hit points, though. Using it grants +8 Morale to the user.{NEWLINE}5 charges per bottle."
  STR_SAKE_UFOPEDIA: "An extremely potent brand of alcohol, made of Hellerium fresh from trans-solar mines. A symbol of status, not often seen on Earth and mostly accessible only to high tier Guild personnel; 8 charges per bottle, boosts Energy by 35 and removes 20 Stun damage."
  STR_MUSHROOM_BEER_UFOPEDIA: "A secret recipe we have learned from an old Mechtoid, brewed from various unspeakable stuff. Drink it if you're brave enough. It gives you an instant boost of +40 Health, even beyond the maximum, but might cause hallucinations and other predictable side effects. You need to have at least 40 Health, too. Reduces Freshness by 30. Works only on oneself."
  STR_HEALING_GEL_UFOPEDIA: "Creepy, quite slow to use, but very effective, healing double the HP per wound, compared to Bandages. 3 charges per item. 4 HP healed per Wound. Useable on oneself."
  STR_BANDAGE_UFOPEDIA: "Allows ye to bandage them Fatal Wounds before ye bleed to death. 2 uses per item. 2 HP healed per Wound. Cannot be used on oneself.{NEWLINE}We can manufacture the Bandages from Uber Clothing (sturdy and slightly irradiated)."
  STR_PAINKILLERS_UFOPEDIA: "Remove 20 Stun Damage and restore 15 Morale to the user. However, they induce weariness (-15 Energy). 3 uses, 6 TUs to use.{NEWLINE}Works only on oneself."
  STR_FIRST_AID_KIT_SMALL_UFOPEDIA: "Has no advantage over 2 bandages other than weight and quicker access (13 TUs). Which is clearly an advantage, it has to be!"
  STR_FIRST_AID_KIT_UFOPEDIA: "A bag of bandages. Heals the same, but holds more uses (10) for its weight and allows for a bit faster treatment (14 TUs instead of 15)."
  STR_SMALL_MEDIPACK_UFOPEDIA: "Featuring some cool medical gizmos, this small kit has 3 uses per battle (3 HP healed per Wound). In addition, it holds 3 doses of painkillers (to restore Morale loss caused by Wounds) and 3 shots of a potent Stimulant (25 Stun damage removed per shot). All in a single, neat package. Cannot be used on oneself.{NEWLINE}Unlimited supply, but $1000 monthly upkeep."
  STR_SPACE_MEDIPACK_UFOPEDIA: "Using the same advanced technology as the Advanced Medipack, this piece of medical equipment was especially designed for space operations. It holds 12 healing charges of each type; however, as it needs to work through space armor, is rather slow in operation (15 TUs).{NEWLINE}Unlimited supply, but $2000 monthly upkeep."
  AUX_SPACE_MEDIPACK_UFOPEDIA: "Internal healing device of a space pod; can be used externally, too. Holds 24 of each: painkillers, stimulants (25 Stun per use), heal (3 HP per Fatal Wound)."
  STR_MEDIPACK_UFOPEDIA: "Much more effective than Bandages, yet much less wieldy and takes a lot of time to use. 5 HP healed per Wound, 10 uses per battle. However, performing medical procedures takes time (25 TUs to use). Cannot be used on oneself."
  AUX_MEDIPACK_UFOPEDIA: "Only available as a part of the Nurse Outfit. It contains a Surgery Kit (5 HP healed per Wound), as well as Painkillers and Stimulants (20 Stun damage restoration). Each of the above has 20 uses per battle, and each use costs 20 TUs. Cannot be used on oneself."
  STR_SUPER_MEDIPACK_UFOPEDIA: "This device works miracles, instantly knitting flesh and restoring lost health that'd take weeks to return normally. 8 HP healed per Wound, 12 uses per battle. Cannot be used on oneself. Requires Surgery Room to manufacture."
  STR_MEDIPACK_SAVIOUR_UFOPEDIA: "By tapping into the Discipline of Communion, we are able to gain healing powers unheard of. Perhaps this art is too subtle or too materialistic for the Star Gods to contemplate. This medical device heals 9 HP per Fatal Wound, can restore 20 Stun & Energy per use, and also contains Painkillers. 30 uses per battle, 15 TUs per use, can be used on oneself.{NEWLINE}It can also be used to deliver slow, but extremely powerful stunning attacks (POWER & ACC = VOODOO Power^2 * 0.04){NEWLINE}However, a special outfit is needed to tap into the power of the device, and to develop one, we need to develop Refractor and Grav armors first."
  STR_STIMM_UFOPEDIA: "This expensive compound is imported by the Smugglers. Good for a single injection, which will quickly restore 25 Stun Damage and 50 Energy. At a price of 5 Freshness. The hypodermic that carries it is good for both undersea and space usage."
  STR_COMBAT_DRUGS_UFOPEDIA: "Injecting this vile stuff gives you a euphoric feeling of invincibility, instantly restoring 40 Stun damage &  giving 80 Energy buff, but hitting you with a -50 Morale penalty (you're likely to go haywire) and -15 Freshness. 3 charges, works only on oneself. Just remember: winners don't do drugs!"
  STR_OXYGEN_TANK_UFOPEDIA: "Pure oxygen inhalation makes you feel as great as any other drug, but can lead to bouts of overconfidence. Prolonged use might cause you to forget how to breathe with Earth's thin air. Each 25 TUs gulp restores 30 Stun and 15 Energy. Lasts for 10 uses."
  STR_GROG_BARREL_UFOPEDIA: "It's crucial to keep high spirits during a battle, hence we have developed this beverage that can be produced at our Still! Since no pirate will drink alone, this barrel holds enough liquor for the whole crew! 30 uses per battle of EACH of the following applications:{NEWLINE}HEALING> Heals one Fatal Wound and restores 3 HP per use.{NEWLINE}STIMULANT> Brings stunned and exhausted pirates back to vertical position (+16 Stun & +24 Energy, -2 Fresh).{NEWLINE}JUICE> Restores Morale lost due to injuries. Does not restore Morale lost due to other causes."
  STR_MEDI_KIT_UFOPEDIA: "More potent than Grog - this bottle is nothing short of a wonder! 6 uses per battle of each of the following: {NEWLINE}HEALING> Removes one Fatal Wound per use and restores 4 Health per Wound.{NEWLINE}STIMULANT> Restores 12 Stun & 25 Energy, -1 Fresh.{NEWLINE}JUICE> Restores Morale lost due to injuries + gives Morale bonus.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}You can also smash people's heads with this reinforced bottle - just be careful, hits with it can cause Fatal Wounds! Swinging a bottle at an enemy in a drunken rage also restores your Morale a bit. {NEWLINE}Melee (Stun = STR*0.5+5, Skill = MA/2+BRA/2, Acc = 70%, 10 TUs)"
  STR_PSI_AMP_UFOPEDIA: "Only those trained in magic can touch their VooDoo rods. {NEWLINE}Wicked things can be done to the enemy, but at a price of taking Energy, Morale and Stun damage (7, 21, 7).{NEWLINE}TERROR> Fills the mind of the hapless victim with images of absolute horror and dread. If the attack is successful it will reduce the target's morale and may cause it to panic. Diff: Medium (+20){NEWLINE}POSSESS> The sorcerer tries to completely dominate target's will, which is a more difficult trick than the previous one. If this is successful then you will gain immediate control of the enemy unit as if it was one of your own. Diff: V. Hard (+0)"
  STR_MIND_PROBE_UFOPEDIA: "This strange device allows you to scan the very soul of your target, and it works even in the hands of magical laymen! Upon using it, you will learn enemy's type and vital statistics, including current health and TUs. Scary, isn't it? But there is more to it - like the possibility of using this mind-reading technology to construct weapons and other devices that can be manipulated with a mere thought..."
  STR_HELLERIUM_CHARM_UFOPEDIA: "Glowing with healthy radiation, this amulet heals 1 point of Stun damage per turn when held in inventory. Be careful, the glow can be seen by enemies. Multiples stack."
  STR_GLITTERSKULL_UFOPEDIA: "At last, we've found a good use for these skulls! With gold plating and gems for eyes, it focuses magical Hellerium energy, improving the regeneration of Energy and Morale of anyone who carries it by 3 (stackable). It also glows in the dark. Requires Summoning Circle to make."
  STR_DRUG_DISPENSOR_UFOPEDIA: "When held in inventory, it automatically connects itself with exposed skin or the life support system of the armor, feeding our Gal with a cocktail of combat drugs. It boosts Energy, Morale and Stun recovery by 5 but drains 2 Freshness per turn. Multiples stack."
  STR_OFFICERS_BATON_UFOPEDIA: "This item isn't much of a weapon, it is rather a symbol of authority, used to smack some sense into these damned Hands. Lash them! Lash them good!{NEWLINE}Each use costs 9 Energy and Morale. Inflicts Stun and improves Morale and TUs of the target.{NEWLINE}Ignores 50% of armor, still using it against armored and Daze-resistant targets is unadvised."
  STR_MASTERS_CANE_UFOPEDIA: "This seemingly normal cane hides arcane circuitry, allowing one to entertain their VooDoo powers. Don't generally expect this to work on enemies more psi-resistant than Beastmen, but it's always something!{NEWLINE}Hex (MIND Dmg = V.Mastery*0.01; Diff: Normal){NEWLINE}Melee attack (Stun = 15+STR*0.2+MA*0.2, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 91%, 8 TUs){NEWLINE}Special: Both V. Effectivity and Hex are increased by twice the Rank (2 for Gal, 10 for a Queen)."
  STR_SAKURA_STAFF_UFOPEDIA: "This fancy staff can be used to control prey's minds (by making them love you or fear you), although it works best only from close-by, and is limited by the line of sight. It also can deliver magically-buffed Stun attacks to take your new pets home. Voodoo Training is required. Usage has an average Energy and Morale cost (18), as well as minor Stun Damage cost (9).{NEWLINE}Increased range penalty (150%){NEWLINE}Melee attack (Stun = V.PWR^2*0.032, Skill = MA/2+V.PWR/2, Acc = 144%, 15 TUs)"
  STR_SCEPTER_OF_FEAR_UFOPEDIA: "Strike fear into enemy hearts with this mighty Scepter, either through its magical power of terror, or the devastating strikes it delivers.

Usage of its magical power drains 4 Energy, 12 Morale, and 12 Stun.{NEWLINE}Low range penalty (50%), requires LoS.{NEWLINE}Melee attack similar to the Spiked Mace, boosted by user's Rank.{NEWLINE}Requires Summoning Circle to be forged."
  STR_PERSUADOTRON_UFOPEDIA: "This might' shifty device is used by various agents of the Star Gods. It allows ye to scare people out of their senses, or even take over their bodies for a while, turning them into big ol' scary puppets. We actually figured which buttons to push; the devious machine seems to be working wholly by itself, the user havin' only to get the target into crosshairs and fire away. The model's name is actually its power rating - whatever that means.{NEWLINE}Increased range penalty (200%)"
  STR_PSI_AMP_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "A radical redesign of the VooDoo Rod, it has superior power and range; on the downside, it's much bulkier and can only be used on targets within line of sight. Each use costs Morale, Energy and Stun damage.{NEWLINE}Curse (MIND Dmg = V.Mastery*0.02; Diff: V. Hard)"
  AUX_PSI_ORB_UFOPEDIA: "A powerful VooDoo focus, used by the Sorceress outfit to possess or terrorize enemies. It works faster and easier, at the price of having a lower power."
  STR_GHOST_BEAM_UFOPEDIA: "The Academicians described this as the magical power the Star Gods themselves use to kill their enemies. It ignores almost all of an enemy's armor and goes directly for their life-force. Even those who survive are gripped by otherworldly terror. We don't know how to employ it on the battlefield yet... will we ever do?"
  STR_GHOST_DAGGER_UFOPEDIA: "This ghastly blade is destined for those who trust mages. Perfect for backstabbing, it ignores 90% of armor and causes the target to panic, even if he survives: yes, it deals LETHAL damage."
  STR_CHAOS_DAGGER_UFOPEDIA: "A weird sacrificial blade, gifted by the Demon Gods to their Lokk'Naar followers (and indeed well suited to their innate abilities). Like water and flame combined, it sets enemies ablaze, but the stronger you are, the softer it becomes. Holding this heretical weapon drains 3 Morale per turn. 20% of HP damage inflicted by it is stolen by the attacker (Bio effect). It ignores some armor and damages it significantly upon penetration."
  STR_CERO_UFOPEDIA: "A highly destructive, explosive attack. Each use burns 88 Energy and 8 Health. The Ball of Annihilation draws and redirects the power of Earth's momentum."
  STR_ARCANE_RAY_UFOPEDIA: "A strange weapon system that comes with the Sapphire Jellyfish. A magically-gifted adept can utilize it to smite enemies with powerful bolts that ignore half the armor and cause extra Morale and Shock damage. The most unusual quality of these bolts is that they can chase the target, even if it's well-hidden; up to seven target points can be set up. When the prey is marked, the spell is released with the special 'Launch' button in the upper-right corner."
  AUX_ROMAN_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "This shield is a part of the Piroman Armor set. Magical symbols depicted on it significantly boost VooDoo Power. Strong and skilled warriors can also use it to knock enemies off their feet."
  AUX_CRUSADER_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "This shield is a part of the Crusader Armor set. Quite effective at stunning, plus it provides a good defensive value."
  AUX_GOTHIC_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "This shield is a part of the Chain Mail armor, and can be used as a very effective stun weapon."
  AUX_TOWER_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "This shield is a part of the Plate Mail armor, and can be used as a very effective stun weapon."
  AUX_SMALL_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "This shield can be used with the Slayer armor. It is a stun weapon in its own right."
  AUX_ROUND_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "This shield can be used with the Barbarian armor. It does not only protect, but also allows one to stun enemies."
  STR_POLICE_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "A shield made of Aqua Plastics. Alongside being a stun weapon, each Riot Shield you carry reduces any Cutting damage you take by 1/4th, up to maximum resistance of 30%. To a lesser degree, it protects against Daze and slightly against Piercing, Laser, Plasma and Chem. It does not, however, increase your armor or Evasion."
  STR_SANDBAGS_UFOPEDIA: "When inside your inventory, these weird, floating sandbags increase your resistance to Piercing, Concussive, Laser and Plasma damage. Any such damage is cut by half, up to maximum resistance of 50% (30% in the case of Concussive). Carrying the Sanbags inflicts 35 Energy damage per turn. How do you use them? It is not my concern."
  AUX_IDENT_UFOPEDIA: "This device, available only through the Brainer outfit, scans the target and displays its vital statistics. Using it costs 30 TUs. The user must have a line of sight to the target."
  AUX_CRYSTAL_BALL_UFOPEDIA: "Looking into the crystal ball will reveal basic data on the targeted enemy. Each use costs 33% TUs and 20 Energy, since it's tiring."
  AUX_BLOOD_MAGIC_UFOPEDIA: "This type of magic sacrifices the user to feed the target. Each use costs 5 Health and 25 Energy, and gives the target a major boost of TUs and Morale, as well as some Health. The magic ignores 2/3rds of target's armor, yet it's still best used on unarmored recipients, and with no Bio resistance. Maximum range is 15. It is also unique for its rumored ability to raise user's VooDoo Power."
  AUX_BAD_TOUCH_UFOPEDIA: "This naughty skill is a melee attack that disables enemies by draining their Time Units (x1), as well as inflicting Stun (x1) and Morale (x3) damage. Armor is 150% effective against this attack.{NEWLINE}Each attack costs 9 Morale, 9 Energy and 1 Freshness.{NEWLINE}Using this attack on enemies trains Bravery and Reactions."
  AUX_GOOD_TOUCH_UFOPEDIA: "This skill greatly envigorates the target (+64 Energy and +6 Freshness). It costs the user 16 Energy and 9 Freshness, but restores 8 Morale. It can be used on oneself. Both sides receive 8 Stun damage."
  AUX_SEDUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "The Seduction attack is a stun-dealing VooDoo attack with good accuracy. Gals of high ranks get a substantial bonus to accuracy. Requires LOS. If it works, it stuns the target (x0.5) and drains their TUs (x1), but it does also improve their Morale (x3).{NEWLINE}Base damage is applied against CHARM resistance, ignoring armor. The lower your Morale, the higher the damage.{NEWLINE}Each use costs 36 TUs and Energy, as well as 6 Morale & 6 Stun damage and 3 Freshness.{NEWLINE}A proper outfit must be worn to use this ability. Double range penalties. Exercising it will train caster's Bravery."
  AUX_LUCKY_STAR_UFOPEDIA: "From our chats with a 'Magical Girl' we have learned about this power, which could be used by combining our powers with theirs. To do so, however, we need to unlock the secret of the 'Excess' branch of VooDoo.{NEWLINE}Each use costs 60 Energy & 30 Stun Damage.{NEWLINE}Ignores 50% of enemy armor."
  AUX_PILLOW_UFOPEDIA: "Equipment of a Pillow Knight. Used to worship the Gals. It raises morale by damage caused, and restores some Freshness, but also inflicts 20% as much Stun. This attack drains Morale and Freshness of the Knight.{NEWLINE}Ignores 50% armor & Shock Immunity."
  STR_ROD_OF_BLISS_UFOPEDIA: "This conspicuous device, when used, will inflict 36 Stun damage upon the target, regardless of resistances or armor, but only on a prone target.{NEWLINE}The item can also be used as a melee weapon, to deliver stunning blows, but those do not ignore either armor or Daze Resistance. They do substantially increase Morale of the victim, though. Melee attack stats below:{NEWLINE}Skill: MELEE/2 + BRAVERY/2; POWER = V.POWER + V.SKILL/2{NEWLINE}TU Cost: 16, Acc: 100%"
  STR_WAND_CHOKE_UFOPEDIA: "This wand creates a vacuum around the victim's head, choking them. It is quite slow for a wand, but none the less very handy in capturing live hostages. Just be careful, overzealous use can kill the victim. Each use costs 15 Energy and 15 Morale. It loses 2 Power for every tile beyond maximum accurate range (which is 11 tiles)."
  STR_WAND_FIRE_UFOPEDIA: "This wand shoots exploding firebolts (blast radius of 1). The fire is extremely hot and causes damage proportional to Power; it also can destroy items on the ground, much like WP ammo, while still ignoring Armor. Its blinding flash disrupts Reactions (x2). Power drops by 2 for every tile beyond accurate range. Each use costs 25 Energy and 5 Morale."
  STR_WAND_PAIN_UFOPEDIA: "This wand causes victims to writhe in excruciating pain. It ignores armor. Causes major Morale damage and disrupts Reactions (x5). Inflicts limited Stun and HP damage. Each use costs 10 Energy and 25 Morale. The accurate range is 11 tiles; Power drops by 2 per every tile beyond it."
  STR_WAND_HARTO_UFOPEDIA: "This wand deals Stunning attacks to enemies, ignoring their armor. Each use costs 40 Energy and 5 Morale. The accurate range is 12 tiles, power drops by 3 for every tile beyond that."
  STR_SKULL_ROD_UFOPEDIA: "This wand hosts a soul of a fiery imp. With enough will, it can be bent to do the sorceress' bidding - that is, if the will is to set everything on fire and send hellish visions to her enemies. Requires VooDoo training. Drains Morale. Requires Summoning Circle.{NEWLINE}Special: Stun +200%"
  STR_FLAME_GLOVE_UFOPEDIA: "A very destructive, yet difficult to master, magical weapon. Fires in an arc.{NEWLINE}Each use costs 25 Energy and 15 Stun Damage.{NEWLINE}Special: Shock x1.5"
  AUX_FLAMING_FISTO_UFOPEDIA: "The unarmed attack of the Moloch armor. As strong as Power Glove when used in melee, and can scorch enemies to ashes with its unreleting flames. Conjuring flames drains a lot of Energy, but a good hit will restore it easily due to Moloch's special powers."
  STR_COBRA_STAFF_UFOPEDIA: "A staff with a magical snake's head, that shoots deadly venom beams. Each use costs 20 Energy and 10 Stun Damage.{NEWLINE}Ignores 50% Armor; Shock x2; Max Range: 20{NEWLINE}The snake head can also be used to bite people in melee, which injects them with sleep poison.{NEWLINE}They say that while the deadly venom is excruciatingly painful, the sleep venom brings extreme pleasure. The reverse is true to the wielder."
  STR_PHANTOM_WHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The pinnacle of whip is achieved when it cleanly passes every imaginable obstacle, while travelling at the speed of thought. We have developed this weapon on the basis of our Codex and the Book of Fire. It is powered by an Orb of Ethyr and deals Mind damage. It has a range of up to 6, but boasts high accuracy and no accuracy dropoff. There is a price, though: in addition to 15% TUs, using the Whip costs 50 Freshness & Energy per attack."
  STR_STAFF_OF_EXPLOSION_UFOPEDIA: "When it comes to battle magic, accept no substitutes. We have developed this staff on the basis of our Codex and the Book of Fire. It is powered by an Orb of Blood. Its destructive power is unparalleled, but each shot requires 150 Freshness and 75 Energy."
  STR_HEARTGRIP_STAFF_UFOPEDIA: "This fearsome staff attempts to crush the heart of its victim upon a successful mental attack (BIO damage type). Requires VooDoo Training to be used.

  STR_HELLGUN_UFOPEDIA: "This infernal weapon will never run out of heat. Requires VooDoo training and Summoning Circle. Drains Morale & Energy."
  STR_TOME_LIGHTNING_UFOPEDIA: "This tome harnesses the power of warp lightning to do your bidding. The attack, not overtly accurate to begin with, starts to quickly lose focus over long distance. It also loses 1 point of power per every tile after 7th. Rqrs. VooDoo training to use, Library & Summ. Circle to manufacture.{NEWLINE}Shock x4; Disrupts Reactions (x4); Damages Armor (10%)"
  AUX_BONG_UFOPEDIA: "In dankest day, in binging night,{NEWLINE} No party shall escape my sight.{NEWLINE}Let those who worship sobriety's might{NEWLINE}Beware my power--Green Bong's delight!{NEWLINE}       -Surreal the Bard{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Clouds of smoke, spewed out by this infernal machine, restore everyone's Morale, Energy and TUs, but cause some Stun damage."
  STR_PIRATE_FLAG_UFOPEDIA: "Use the flag to restore squad morale! And give them some Time Units! Those wearing Daze-resistant outfits will benefit less, as will those who are inherently brave.{NEWLINE}Has a secondary melee attack option (Stun = 10+STR*0.4, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 85%, 12 TUs){NEWLINE}To manufacture the flag, we need to gather various trophies to prove our worth."
  STR_PIRATE_PIPES_UFOPEDIA: "Works like the Battle Flag, but is more powerful - and makes hell of a noise, too. Requires Library to be manufactured - you need to get musical inspiration somewhere!"
  STR_PIRATE_GUITAR_UFOPEDIA: "This electric dragon operates at 80.000 Volts to unleash an unrelenting barrage of Heavy Metal, which gives the gals a ton of TU and Morale recovery."
  SPC_CUM_OR_ELSE_UFOPEDIA: "A VooDoo power available to wearers of the Kummissar outfit. Its main purpose is to restore Time Units to a single target. It works quickly, however side effects include serious Morale loss (power tripping). The ability works with full force up to 2 tiles away, and its Power is diminished by 2 for each tile beyond that range. Each use costs 20 Energy and Morale."
  STR_TK_DEVICE_UFOPEDIA: "This is a conversion of the magical shackles we use to keep our magical slaves. It emits a powerful telekinetic wave that stuns people and destroys walls. It doesn't damage items on the ground.{NEWLINE}Limited Range (13){NEWLINE}Special: Armor -50%, Demolition +150%"
  AUX_TK_MAGE_HAND_UFOPEDIA: "This Sorceress' telekinetic power works very similarly to a TK Device, but it is not only stronger, but also has a much greater range (hence the name), up to 39 tiles - even though it suffers from serious inaccuracy at such ranges.{NEWLINE}Special: Armor -50%, Demolition +150%"
  STR_LASER_PISTOL_MINI_UFOPEDIA: "Well-liked by the Academicians, this pistol is small and handy, quite accurate, and the large battery won't run out of juice during engagement. Downsides: high price, dismal power (mitigated by armor piercing, true for all lasers) and the tendency of the aforementioned battery to go up in flames."
  STR_LASER_PISTOL_LT_UFOPEDIA: "While not very powerful, this mysterious weapon will magically never run out of charge. No, we totally don't plug it to the hideout's power grid to recharge. Seriously."

  STR_LASLOCK_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "A funky weapon for funky Captains, that, according to some, has more of a morale effect than actual usefulness. It employs two stacks of 6 small lasers each to deliver a wide-spread blast."
  STR_LASER_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "What a laser is, everyone sees. It might not be extremely powerful, but it's very accurate and burns through various forms of advanced armor like a sting. A burning one, that is."
  STR_SMASHER_UFOPEDIA: "In a bout of genius, no less, we figured out how to make a sustained laser that requires no reloads during battle. Don't ask any questions about the design as it involved a lot of mind-altering drugs. It is a miracle it works at all. Finding uses for it is your job, Cap'n."
  STR_STORM_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "A lightweight, fast-firing laser weapon. Suffers only 15% Acc penalty when used single-handed."
  STR_LASER_PISTOL_M_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy laspistol used by the Mutant Alliance. Pretty strong but has a low shot count.{NEWLINE}Gun Butt: Daze = 15+STR*0.4, Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 70%, 12 TUs)."

  STR_LASGUN_UFOPEDIA: "The lasgun is pretty much a perfect personal arm - very accurate and quite powerful for its size. Like the pistol, it uses two kinds of batteries - we can only replicate the weaker ones."
  STR_HEAVY_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "The heavy laser is cumbersome, but extremely effective. The batteries we can manufacture hold only a quarter of the charge, but the firepower loss is minimal."

  STR_LASER_BALL_UFOPEDIA: "A shoulder-mounted intelligent weapon. Anyone who is being mean to you will get a laser beam, or a dozen. You don't even need to know how to shoot, just squint your eyes and press the button. This won't help honing your skills much, but do you even need them now?"
  STR_SNIPER_LASER_PIR_UFOPEDIA: "A rare laser weapon, due to very low production tolerances. Lightweight and extremely accurate."
  STR_SNIPER_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "A rifle-sized nuclear laser, with unmatched accuracy yet still more hitting power than a lasgun."
  STR_AUTO_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "A laser-equivalent of a machinegun. Incurs serious encumbrance, but few weapons can rival its ability to lay down a large weight of accurate long-range fire."

  STR_SR_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "Weapons like these are made for the Space Rangers of the Stellar Empire and lack the boring perfection of their military designs, thus being quite cool. The Lawpistol (oh irony) is probably the most powerful laser pistol in existence, if rather slow to fire."
  STR_SR_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Extremely accurate, it makes sure no-one escapes the eye of Space Ranger justice. Especially effective in ambushes. Do not let the size deceive you, it's mostly plastic and much lighter than it looks."

  STR_SL_EMP_UFOPEDIA: "This exotic kind of Minibomb uses something called 'Electo-Magnetic Pulse Effect' which is especially deadly to electronics, but will affect, to some degree, anything that has a nervous system. Deals a lot of secondary stun damage (but does not ignore Shock Immunity)."
  STR_NOVA_PLASMA_GUN_UFOPEDIA: "A Human rendition of the Reticulan Plasma Gun. The plasma projectile was given a spin, which greatly improved accuracy and efficiency, at the price of even more limited range. Humans consider it an improvement."

  STR_RECRUIT_PEASANTS_UFOPEDIA: "We have visited the nearby villages, trying to forge some sort of alliance with these Outzoners. Peasants are proud people, and they said that while we won't recruit any men, their women are still tougher than most cityboys! With a sufficient monetary encouragement (which can go towards the well-being of the villages, or maybe a luxurious life for a single individual), we found no shortage of willing subjects. Peasants are healthy and wilful (they will fight even when seriously injured) but they're untrained in combat, neither do they possess our robust Uber physiques. They will take $2500 monthly salary."
  STR_PEASANT_MILITIA_UFOPEDIA: "Freshly recruited Peasants, while cute and willing, are not any good at fighting. But we, being legendary heroes of sorts, can train them to be better at it! With more knowledge on weapons' handling their survival rate should rise. We have also devised a suitable Peasant armor to further increase their abilities."

  STR_HOLY_WARRIORS_UFOPEDIA: "As Pirates, we are a part of the proud tradition of opposing tyrrany, a tradition that dates back to the most ancient times. Now we fight the so-called Star Gods and their lackeys. In this fight, we got help from our 'Slave Soldiers'. They are not our slaves, though. We're all slaves to this sacred cause of liberation! And we shall raise holy fervour in those hesitant, with the help of what we have learned from our allies and enemies!{NEWLINE}(New Training Available)"
  STR_HERO_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Heroes are human warriors, marked by the fates. Their skills often surpass normal human limits and enter the realm of legends. There is no way to recruit them normally; they can only join us out of their free will."
  STR_SUPER_SLAVE_UFOPEDIA: "Combining our recent experience with books and our profound knowledge of mutant porn, we came to a staggering insight. Even if a zine contains pictures, you can still read the corresponding text! This opens up a whole new way to acquire information. In that way we learned, in ancient times there was a man, who worked as some kind of newsperson. He was completely inept and even his girlfriend thought he was a dork. But when he donned his costume, he became very strong, shot lasers from his eyes und generally stopped being his useless self. However, because he looked ridiculous in this costume of his, everybody pretended not to recognize him when he wore it. Anyways, here is our plan. To use this mighty voodoo, we replicate this costume, dress up a slave and shove him in the direction of our enemies. All we need are some rags and pigments refined from soylent blue and soylent red. What could possibly go wrong?"
  STR_CORPSE_SUPER_SLAVE_UFOPEDIA: "It appears that all we got from our carefully planned and conducted procedure was a slave in a silly cape. Retracing our steps we noticed a flaw in our initial data. It seems that the brainer tasked with evaluating the source material was not properly trained in our new method of actually reading the text and just looked at the pictures. We can guarantee that such a mistake will not happen again. Meanwhile, diligent cross-referencing revealed that the voodoo does not stem solely from the costume itself, but that a suitable wearer has to be bitten by a radioactive critter first. Then, the voodoo unfolds from an interaction between costume and wearer. ATM we have some very promising leads concerning severely radiated bats. Expect a research proposal soon!"
  STR_GREEN_LIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "Apparently, the gals don't believe in drugs. That can be quite a nuisance during prolonged battles, as even the toughest of our gals need a break after a few hours of constant skirmish. And here is our solution. Despite the superslaves' rather disappointing performance (which was in no way our fault), the gals still believe in superheroes! Well, if it takes another slave in a silly costume for the gals to take their medicine, so be it. With our tested procedure (we knew this would come in handy), we will dress up another slave, tell the gals that he is imbued with Hellerium, and that he can recharge them with his magical smoke. They will know this to be true, because there are some historic zines about a voodoo lighter recharging a voodoo necklace or something. Nay, of course there is no actual need to involve any nuclear fuel! The slave will just supply good old pervitin."
  STR_CORPSE_GREEN_LIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "Yes, there was nuclear fuel involved. I never said there wouldn't! I just said there was no need to! So, I did not lie, technically! And this very violent biochemical reaction was unforeseeable. But we think we might be able to harness this energy source somehow. Whud? No, we didn't plan this! The warning label stating that this equipment is prone to explosion, spontaneous combustion and might cause hair loss is routinely attached to everything we design.{NEWLINE}...Can you remove these, uh, ropes now? It's quite... degrading this way, you know."
  STR_BAT_GLAD_UFOPEDIA: Okay, there is this zine about that batbuddy, who seems to have only two occupations in life. Either he is fighting some weird clown or he is banging this batlad Robby Werham. No wonder the gals absolutely love batbuddy! But no matter how often we let our radioactive bats bite our test slaves, no superpowers emerged. So we focused on the mechanical aspect and built this really cool bat armor with an extra-strong cape. But... The gals insisted that (a) the armor is obviously a toy, (b) batbuddy didn't have any superpowers, it was all in the armor, only, it clearly isn't, and (c) back armor is useless. One of the brainerz (not me of course) replied that an armored back was perfect for running away with the booty. Some comments about the size of certain backsides, especially their lower parts, followed. Then, fists were flying. In the end, we reached a compromise. The gals will continue to use the bat armor as a toy and a combat capable slave will test it in battle.
  STR_CORPSE_BAT_GLAD_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Well, maybe this design needs some more front armor. Nevertheless, analyzing the combat damage we are quite proud of the amount of damage this thing can suck up. So let's concentrate on this picture - I believe I can see great research potential here!"
  STR_FLASH_BANG_UFOPEDIA: "All right, all right! When you told me you want me to go all out I thought you were making a move on me! You should have told me you weren't before we went through all this! Despite what I said, I won't marry you, by the way, we're the same sex, remember? Glad we have this sorted... So we wanted to turn the latest disaster into a success and work on making our superslaves more energetic, even if it kills them. Turning a bug into a feature, we call it. So there was this guy in Old Earth days who was a real flash banger, and with the right costume, electro-stimulators and enough radioactive stuff, we can make our slaves just like him. He will have great speed, just won't last long, predictably. Guess what happens when his lifeline ends."
  STR_CORPSE_FLASH_BANG_UFOPEDIA: "It is a true miracle you managed to secure his corpse from all this mess. Because he caused a mess, am I right? Anyway, such a wealth of research data, and no punishment for me this time... But I will take both good and bad and you just wait!"
  STR_LOOTED_CYBERDISC_HMG_UFOPEDIA: "I'm afraid that our custom-rebuilt Cyberdisc inherited the original design flaw - or maybe it was a feature? When destroyed, it explodes. BIG TIME.

  TRUCK_TURRET_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "The turret mounted on Truck chassis (see 'Vessels & Armaments'). If it gets destroyed, you will be billed $20k for it; this will take 20 storage space as collateral, and $5k monthly fee until paid."
  AUX_ROTOGUN_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA: "The weapon installed in Truck's turret. It hits harder than a normal Rotogun, and has a better accurate range, but the soft bullets suffer a hefty penalty vs. armor (+60%). Ammunition costs are included in Truck's maintenance."

  STR_HWP_ROCKETS_ACID_UFOPEDIA: "This shell was designed to inflict maximum damage to terrain and armor, literally melting them away im ein Augenblick, as the world-class experts on such things say. It has a blast radius of 9 and enough power to melt through a plastasteel hull."
  STR_HWP_ROCKETS_WP_UFOPEDIA: "A very large shell, filled to the brim with White Phosphorous. It creates an instant crematorium, 12 tiles in radius."
  STR_TANK_FLAK_UFOPEDIA: "A twin flak cannon for crowd control purposes. Quite complex to make, it uses three kinds of ammo. The first is heavy buckshot. The second is Chem buckshot to destroy armor. The third is rubber pellets for captures."
  AUX_ACAR_WEAPON_FLAMER_UFOPEDIA: "Vehicle mounting allows the flamer to operate at higher pressures, significantly increasing its range (25). It runs through Heavy Flamer tanks extremely quickly, but is also reasonably swift to reload."
  STR_TANK_LASER_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "No armor can withstand the power of this laser cannon, but it can be thwarted by energy shields. 50% armor penetration. Very long range: only 2/3 no-Los penalties."

  SECTOPOD_ARMOR_2_UFOPEDIA: "We have managed to turn one of the Stellar Empire's most feared weapons, the Sectopod, against their former masters! They should've known better than to mess with us. The disgusting magitech has been removed and replaced with standard circuitry. The already-impressive endurance has been improved, although the machine is more cumbersome than its alien counterpart."
  STR_XENFORCER_CHASSIS_UFOPEDIA: "The documents we've found identify this derelict, centuries-old hulk of 10-feet tall assault droid as 'Xenforcer'. Seems like it was found during some tombraiding and being carried for some high-bidder. We don't have the slightest idea how to repair this imposing machine, but we can salvage it for Power Armor parts, superconductive wire and a whole lot of assorted junk. Neither the machine's thinking circuits or reactor once used to power it survived in any useable shape."
  STR_SIMULACRUM_UFOPEDIA: "The Necronomicon speaks of Simulacra as creations of Chorts, a race of inhumanly evil, shapeshifting demons immensely skilled in matter transmutation, worshippers of the dark deity YOG-SOTOTH. These contraptions were gifted to dark sorcerers in exchange for human sacrifices as means to achieve powers of Chorts, including immortality. Then goes a description how a sorceror connects to Simulacrum's brain and her soul is slowly and torturously transferred into this cast of cold, liquid metal. During this process, the sorceror subconsciously shapeshifts her new form into something more resembling herself - on the outside, that is.{NEWLINE}To assemble a Simulacrum, we need Red Tower's lab."
  STR_SIMULACRUM_TORSO_UFOPEDIA: "What seemed like a torso of some weird and ominous statue, turned out to be something even more weird and ominous upon close examination. Under the nigh-indestructible shell, there are innumberable circuits, systems and mechanisms. They approximate the general layout of human female body - if it was drawn by some mad and alien creature. It doesn't seem to fit construction principles of any robot known to us, either, and, plainly, makes little sense. The torso has two large internal cavities - one in the chest, where a huge number of conduits concentrates, and another in the skull, behind the crystal optical system (or a decorative eye - we don't know). We assume it misses crucial parts in these places, which could explain its inertness - if the infernal machine is functional at all, and not some elaborate hoax."
  STR_SIMULACRUM_ARMS_UFOPEDIA: "A pair of arms, belonging to some big, gothic statue. Or so it seemed until closer scrutiny. There are mechanism inside these arms, and several systems of conduits, which look quite insane but are certainly capable of passing high energies. There are also inscriptions in some unknown language all over these things, visible only through a microscope. It appears like a weird fusion of a work of art, machine and occult."
  STR_SIMULACRUM_LEGS_UFOPEDIA: "The appearance of a statue belies the truth; the insanely hard metal outside hides inside resembling that of a human body, including connections to spinal cord and highly concentrated energy conduits in the pelvic area, similar to nerves surrounding a Gal's unmentionables. Mechanisms and circuits inside legs suggest mobility, but we were unable to move them, as the shell is completely rigid, which in itself makes the whole item paradoxical. The thing also appears to be frigtheningly ancient, if the weathered surface of this superhard metal is any indicator."
  STR_SIMULACRUM_HEART_UFOPEDIA: "The name 'heart' came up when we realized this is much more than just a power unit. The sophisticated network of connections suggests it also has some computing functions. The machine is actually working, on a low energy state, but we were unable to attune to it in any way that would provoke a predictable reaction. Since the real nature of both the power source and the whole thing in general remains unknown, we've postponed further experimentation. Who knows if the thing won't explode with an incalculable force?"
  STR_SIMULACRUM_BRAIN_UFOPEDIA: "The nature of this item defies understanding. It is obviously a brain... a brain cast from an unknown metal and easily as intricate as a real, human brain. The outer casing is a hard armored shell, with several outgoing connectors - spine, skull nerves, all that stuff. When electric current is ran through the brain, the metal on the inside switches to liquid phase.

  STR_LOADER_ARMOR_GNOME_SEA_UC_UFOPEDIA: "Gnomes refuse to explored the depths without proper gear on, and this rig fits the bill perfectly. Cannot Run, Strafe or Kneel. HUGE Target. Inventory: 28. Vis: 20."

  STR_NIGHT_OPS_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "A simple vision enhancement device gives us superior night sight, while improving Firing accuracy, but the loss of peripheral vision has a bad effect on Reactions.

  STR_LINGERIE_SET_UFOPEDIA: "Classy outfit designed to employ the powers of seduction. Like with the Wench outfit, neither hand is available for equipping to not ruin the disguise. Wt = 3. Too constricting to allow running. Inventory: 10. Evasion: REA*25% + BRA*20%"
  STR_LINGERIE_SET_X_UFOPEDIA: "A 'civilized' outfit, useable for infiltration missions - a certain kind of 'civilized', for sure. Employs Bad & Good Touch as the only 'weapons'. A Wench looks so harmless that enemies might have trouble hitting her in melee. As a downside, she cannot run in this outfit (high heels, duh). Evasion: REA*35% + BRA*30%. Combat Stress +4. Inventory: 4."
  STR_MAGICAL_GIRL_OUTFIT_UFOPEDIA: "An enchanted, symbiotic, sentient, flying outfit, which basically is a Magical Girl willingly lending her powers to one of the Hands.

  STR_PILOTED_VEHICLES_UFOPEDIA: "Deploying vehicles on the battlefield would substantially increase our firepower, but we're facing severe space and weight constraints, hence the vehicle has to be small, with a very tight cockpit (especially for us, Ubers). Such a vehicle takes an Aux slot in a craft and counts as 4 soldiers. We need to remember to make sure gals using vehicles are on the top of crew list, else we might have trouble loading them. Secondly, vehicle weapons might need to be manually loaded at deployment (SHIFT+LMB to unload)."
  STR_ACAR_UFOPEDIA: "Armor, Firepower and Mobility: these win the field, and we can get them the hard way by getting advanced tech, or the easier way, by commissioning armored cars. We decided on a modular design here, so we acquire Chassis and Weapons separately, then we can Assemble them into a vehicle, and Dissassemble again when we want to change it.{NEWLINE}Armored cars can be piloted by most of our warriors. Require $5k monthly maintenance.{NEWLINE}Carry Capacity: 16/250. NV: 10."
  STR_ACAR_2MG_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "The most straightforward of Armored Car types, it is armed with a twin machinegun that can be easily fired on the move."
  STR_ACAR_HMG_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "Due to the HMG being slower than twin MGs, this version of Armored Car fares marginally worse in hit-and-run tactics."
  STR_ACAR_AC25MM_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "An armored car version that carries the airborne 25mm cannon."
  STR_ACAR_AGL_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "Courtesy of Dr. Wang's Emporium, we can now assemble Armored Cars armed in Automatic Grenade Launchers. This weapon is pretty heavy and cumbersome, but delivers a lot of explosive ordnance for such a small package."
  STR_ACAR_RPG_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "This type of Armored Car carries a quad RPG launcher, good for both tank-fighting and indiscriminate bombardment due to its arcing trajectory."
  STR_ACAR_105_RECOILLESS_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "Arguably the heaviest variant of the Armored Car, it is best when expecting heavy combat. Although its armor protection might prove not enough for such a serious combat..."
  STR_ACAR_FLAK_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "This pattern of Armored Car packs a pair of smoothbore autocannons, that fire heavy buckshot as well as variety of specialty munitions. Basically a giant mobile shotgun."
  STR_ACAR_FLAMER_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "A version of Armored Car mounting a modified Heavy Flamer. It is even more mobile than Twin MG version and the reduced load allows it to have some extra cargo space."
  STR_ACAR_LASCANNON_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "Armored Car armed with a Lascannon. Highly effective against enemy tanks due to the combination of good mobility and a weapon that is exceptionally good at piercing armor."
  STR_ACAR_GAUSS_CANNON_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "Perhaps the most powerful anti-tank/anti-fortification variant of the Armored Car. The power of Gauss weapons is well-known, and this car carries quite a big specimen."
  STR_ACAR_PLASMA_CANNON_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "A flimsy armored car, armed with a devastatingly powerful X-Plasma cannon. What can go wrong?"

  STR_HOVERTANK_PIR_UFOPEDIA: "They say there's an unbearable lightness about a Hovertank. It can fly, including in 0-G. It employs gravitic propulsion, cybernetic interface and energy shields (250/25, Blue). It is armed with a small laser weapon, plus one Armored Car-sized vehicle weapon. Researching a corresponding version of Armored Car is required first. As for pilots, only Lokk'Naars are small enough to fit, and with difficulty.{NEWLINE}High maintenance costs ($75k per month).{NEWLINE}Carry Capacity: 12/175.{NEWLINE}NV: 25. ThV: 60%"

  STR_TANKP_UFOPEDIA: "Miniature tanks are much tougher than Cars, but also slower. With much better electronics, they provide improved vision and accuracy, and allow a single person to operate two weapons.

  STR_WOLVERIN_SUIT_UFOPEDIA: "Biomimetics is the art of emulating solutions tested and proven true by Mother Nature.

  STR_WOLVERIN_BASIC_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "When you have no idea what armaments to use, go with the standard HMG - you will never be wrong. The pitfall of such choice here is the unfeasibility of reloading this weapon in battle due to how the Mecha Suit is constructed."
  STR_WOLVERIN_MINIGUN_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "Nothing clears the landing zone like several well-measured minigun bursts. This Mecha Suit variant allows to use the Vulcan to its full potential."
  STR_WOLVERIN_ELECTRIFIER_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "This pattern of the Mecha Suit is dedicated to engaging EMP-vulnerable enemies, as well as to stunning people. Its weapon has limited range, but unlimited ammunition."

  STR_XEC_SUIT_UFOPEDIA: "Those Sectopods sure are scary, but the Star Gods, for all their power, constantly fail where we do excel: adapt, assimilate, innovate (and be unafraid of mad ideas). Thus we present to you a new toy of immense power, the XEC suit. Granted, cramming all that stuff inside the frame left little room for cockpit (even with Arcane Interface). Some retard even suggested cutting off gals' limbs to fit. Oh sure, we could have made it bigger, but what's the point, if Lokk'Naars and Gnomes are more than adequate pilots? (Maint.: $150k/mth)."
  STR_XEC_SCOUT_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "The most basic pattern of XEC suit. Secondary weapon: Scout Array. SHIELDS: 500/25 (Blue). NV: 25. ThV: 70%. SPOT: 5."

  AUX_XEC_WEAPON_QUAD_LASCANNON_UFOPEDIA: "The weapon mounted on Terminator XEC pattern. Because what's even better than two lascannons? Four! The downside is insane Energy drain."

  AUX_XEC_WEAPON_TWIN_XPLASMA_UFOPEDIA: "Very fast to operate thanks to XEC's Arcane Interface. Devastating firepower, but inaccurate at extreme ranges and causes very high Energy drain due to overheating."

  STR_AM_BALLS_ACID_UFOPEDIA: "These rounds splash acid, destroying terrain and enemy armor in a quite impressive fashion."
  STR_AM_BALLS_SMOKE_UFOPEDIA: "When you suddenly feel too exposed, these rounds will provide just the perfect cover."
  STR_AM_BALLS_GAS_UFOPEDIA: "Poison ammunition comes in different sizes and shapes. These rounds, for instance, are a bit larger than Poison Gas Grenades."
  STR_AM_BALLS_EMP_UFOPEDIA: "Not as potent as handheld EMP Grenades, these rounds however have a major advantage in range and numbers."
  AUX_RETRIBUTION_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "Launches heavy nuclear missiles which can be remotely guided (up to 3 waypoints). They suffer no out-of-LoS accuracy penalties, but are very inaccurate if you try to hit something that's close to you. Not like accuracy matters much for a mass-destruction weapon."
  AUX_TANK_PSI_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "Fires off a ray of dark sorcerous energy which... well, it's not hard to guess what it does. 90% of enemy armor is ignored. Not much effect on inanimate matter. Very little Energy consumption, but damages user's Morale despite all the protective circuits. Accuracy and damage dropoff by 1 per every tile after 20th."
  AUX_XEC_SCOUT_ARRAY_UFOPEDIA: "The Scout Array expands the functions of XEC's Arcane Interface, allowing the vehicle to not only scan enemies, but also to see invisibles from further away, and to see further through darkness and smoke."
  STR_BOMBARD_ARMOR_UC_UFOPEDIA: "A piloted vehicle, armed with a huge gun with an autoloader arm. So huge, in fact, that only Lokk'Naars are small enough to drive this contraption. Nobody else is insane enough to be locked up with so much explosives, anyway. Cargo: 16/750. $25k monthly maint."
  STR_QUAD_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "A small vehicle that lets a Slave Soldier become a fast scout. Or a cavalry man, because it leaves one hand free to operate personal weapons. Unarmed. Carry Cap: 16/75. NV: 16. Lights. Can strafe."
  STR_BIKE_Q_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "A heavily armored bike/power armor set, armed with an Auto-Ax and Super Shooty Gun.

  STR_FOOD_BAG_UFOPEDIA: "This is what passes for the daily bread on our planet. While relatively affordable and effective at keeping starvation at bay, the taste was never supposed to be its selling point, it seems."
  STR_CONSUMER_GOODS_UFOPEDIA: "Assorted, useless junk, for some reason very sought after throughout the general population. It'd be better to get rid of it before our Gals hear its siren call.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 30k"
  STR_MEDICAL_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA: "Medical supplies are in great value on this disease-ridden, dangerous planet. We can either sell them for good money or use them to manufacture medical kits."
  STR_LONGEVITY_SERUM_UFOPEDIA: "A furiously sought-after and prohibitively expensive commodity. While it doesn't give eternal life (you'd need a fabled RETEGES chamber for that), and has countless side-effects, it does indeed make a person look and feel much younger, and can at least double one's lifespan. It's some kind of a regenerative solution, although its contents or workings are unknown."
  STR_CYBERORGAN_UFOPEDIA: "A cybernetic bodypart replacement, popular amongst aliens, but restricted on Earth due to Academy deeming such contraptions odious to humanity. Obtaining this technology promises some interesting breakthroughs, even though integrating such device with our Hellerium-based physiology would be extremely challenging."
  STR_ORGAN_CARRIER_UFOPEDIA: "This sealed container uses stasis field to keep internal organs fresh and ready for transplant. Usually this makes no sense, as it is easier to transport wealthy patient to nearest cloning facility, but these organs were harvested off actual people. They are thus precious to superstitious Academy honchos, who believe such organs will keep them young and pretty for longer than mundane and boring, cloned replacements. I guess we'll throw these to the reapers and sell the container itself, as the organs are useless for anyone but their destined patients. However I believe the Mutant Alliance might be willing to take them off our hands as incriminating evidence against the Academy."
  STR_FUNGO_UFOPEDIA: "This mushroom-based soft drink is a healthy and legal way to introduce the customer to the intricate secrets of Reticulan quisine. It carries absolutely no risk of mutation, headache, diarrhea, skin diseases, hair loss, epileptic seizures, loss of voice, paralysis, blindness, berserk rage, heart attack, or any other affliction commonly associated with Reticulan concotions.

  STR_CIGS_UFOPEDIA: "Named so because they allow you to keep calm, and possibly even achieve nirvana faster, physical health be damned.{NEWLINE}Having a smoke boosts Morale by 18, Energy by 6 and Freshness by 3, but also results in taking 1 Health and 6 Stun damage. 20 uses.

  STR_CRACK_UFOPEDIA: "Used by those particularly downed by our crapsack reality to leave it for a better world. With continued usage, permanently so.{NEWLINE}A particularly debauched pirate who uses it will immediately receive a boost of 100 Morale and 50 Energy, but at a cost of 3 Health and 12 Freshness.{NEWLINE}Works only on oneself."
  STR_WINE_UFOPEDIA: "A major curtular br-breakthrough, this luxuriousss, apple-based wine will surely in-crease the intellectual level of our base by bounds and leaps, as vulgar binge drinking is replaced by highly-cultured binge drinking, which spurs higher-level abstract thinking. We've already had a groundbreaking realization that can be our salvation: the sell value of our beverage itself can be abstract, lo and behold the culturization!"
  STR_ELECTRONIC_PIECES_UFOPEDIA: "These pieces of advanced Star God technology are forbidden to have without special permission, naturally. We can use them to assemble all sorts of rare stuff, or simply sell them for a much better value. The heart of the system is an 'optronic' computation device, but it also contains an insane plethora of other arcane components, to make it a basic building block of many other technologies, as well as to defy easy understanding."
  STR_PADD_UFOPEDIA: "The most popular brand amongst Humans and Beastmen, called Elvenstone. It can be used to take pictures, play music, make phone calls etc. Has some data storage capacity. We can disassemble them to get Personal Databases and Integrated Circuits, and whatever else is on the disk, like bank account passwords. Disassembly requires a Lab.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The Elvenstone, like any other stone, can be also used to bash skulls, just don't scratch the screen!{NEWLINE}Melee (Stun = STR*0.5, Skill = MA, Acc = 70%, 8 TUs){NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Caution: the Elvenstone emits faint light, which might betray your position."
  STR_ILLEGAL_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "Turns out that this ancient data disc had some sensitive data archived between normal pirated recordings. We've found out because we read it using our mainframe instead of a 'personal computer'. We should always be on a lookout for such hidden data before we simply sell it for a dollar."
  STR_PINUP_MAGAZINE_UFOPEDIA: "This magazine is about the difficult trade of Girl Guides, who explore dangerous areas of the world in exchange for nothing more than experience, fame and an occasional cookie. In addition to containing truly fabulous pinups of aforementioned Guides (Ubers or otherwise), it also features a wealth of useful tips on survival."
  STR_GUNS_N_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "A luxurious magazine, sponsored by the Blackops corporation, the reader's choice of any gun fanatic. Not only does it contain numerous articles on the usage of firearms, but also truly pornographic illustrations of disassembled guns. From it, we can learn about functions and capabilities of many interesting weapons, from Assault Rifles to big cannons. The magazine concentrates on the middle tier of the market, thus we won't find here any real junk, but neither any really hi-tech or restricted weapons."
  STR_BRIEFCASE_UFOPEDIA: "A locked briefcase filled with 'top secret' papers. We can read them to learn about Earth's countries and shipping activities, or fence the thing away on the Black Market for some good coin (only unopened briefcases sell, since broken ones are seen as fraudulent; people are so mean and untrusting these days!)."
  STR_OLD_BOOKS_UFOPEDIA: "Old Earth books contain all sorts of stories and knowledge the Star Gods find dangerous for some reason, probably sheer nastiness. There are however people quite desperate to get these books, and we can squeeze a good coin out of these weirdos."
  STR_ESOTERICA_UFOPEDIA: "These are weird books of exciting yet intellectual nature, that hold little solid information, but can be researched for the fun of it (they will take time to comprehend, but this will be more than compensated in score). They can be also sold for some coin."
  STR_PORN_UFOPEDIA: "We have taken a closer look at these zines and we found a lot of anatomically very correct and detailed drawings of naked people. This particular issue features multi limbed people. You wouldn't guess what a lad with three arms can do. Or perhaps you would. Anyways, after exposing this issue to some of the gals, they felt inspired to drag a few three armed hunks into our hideout for further anatomical studies. Therefore we reclassify this reading material as educational instead of recreational."
  STR_ART_PIECE_UFOPEDIA: "Really well-made, yet boring nudes. Not very informative, but can fetch some decent price amongst hipsters because they're supposedly 'original', whatever that means.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 12k"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_UFOPEDIA: "The leading newspaper in the whole Solar System. A bull-horn of Star Gods' propaganda, printed by the Traders Guild. But it has news on celebrities! And sports!"
  STR_PILLOW_BOOK_UFOPEDIA: "These books contain stories inspired by the Mutant Porn. They require a Library to make but can be further researched for even more ideas, or used in battle (up to five times) to restore Morale. A Pillow Book will restore 50 Morale to the target, but takes lots of time to use, as well as makes the reader sleepy (but increases their Freshness)."
  STR_ARCANE_BOOK_UFOPEDIA: "These valuable and rare books contain information on various things arcane, like demons, or artifacts. Getting that information out of them isn't trivial, though, as they're written in a very complicated way. A Library is needed for cross-referencing to decipher them."
  STR_LIBER_OCCULTIS_UFOPEDIA: "This ancient tome is written in an ancient tongue. We don't really understand it, but we get better at pretending to (e.g., hours of learned dispute about correct declinations). With a few candles, a slave, and more of these books we might be able to summon an arcane being. It will either fight our enemies deliciously or bake delicious cookies for us - depends on whether this blot here is an umlaut mark or just a squashed insect. Oh, right, and we'll need a professional summoning circle, too."
  STR_LIBER_OCCULTIS_TRANSLATED_UFOPEDIA: "Forcing a Church Reverend to translate the book yielded a ton of chaotic information, which took a real effort to piece together into a comprehensible form, which is as follows.{NEWLINE}The first part of the book concerns Church cosmology. It claims that the Stellar Empire dates back millions of years ago. They were busy seeding life on various planets, until a mysterious enemy, known only by the name of 'Inciters' appeared. A schism took place - the Star Gods as we know them today abandoned the old ways to better fight the war; other Star Gods, henceforth called the Elder Gods, claimed that convenience doesn't justify abandoning the old ways. The Church, therefore, is obedient to the Empire, but it also secretly holds the Star Gods to be imperfect.{NEWLINE}The second part of the book concerns Church philosophy, described by words Pleasure in Perfection, Elegance in Timing, Refuge in Creation. Reading between the verses, you can feel their loathing towards the Academy in particular, but also, strangely, towards the Reticulans. In contrast, the Deep Ones are seen as pure.{NEWLINE}The third, most exciting part, concerns performing VooDoo rites - we're ready to start experiments at any time!"
  STR_BOOK_OF_FIRE_UFOPEDIA: "This book of rare magic will allow us to design a unique Codex weapon. We will need to study the 'Shadow Orbs' and understand the principles of Magitech to do that.{NEWLINE}(Work In Progress)"
  STR_NECRONOMICON_UFOPEDIA: "This book is a work of pure madness, and merely examining it can make you experience hallucinations, like the tome making faces at you, calling you names or trying to bite off your fingers. This bandage? There is far too much sharp stuff around the lab! Anyway, the book seems to cover all sorts of weirdness, like summoning demons, raising the dead, and traveling to other planes of existence. Understanding it, however, seems a hopeless task, at least if you value your mind. I have another idea, though: with enough command of the book's language, and help of hallucinogenic drugs, we can add some extra pages to it. It seems such edits have been made several times already, now that I think about it."
  STR_CODEX_OF_THE_TRANSFIGURATION_UFOPEDIA: "This completely insane arcanistic text describes the process of human ascension into a higher form of existence. This form is different, but definitely physical, as the scripture dismisses non-corporealism.{NEWLINE}Mysticism aside, the Grimoire provides detailed instructions on the process, which in its ultimate stage requires a machine called 'The Anvil of Souls'. Which, if the book is to be believed, is located in Hell itself. Yeah. Very useful."
  STR_CHURCH_RITUALS_UFOPEDIA: "In pursuit of their 'perfection', the Church secretly delves into unspeakable debauchery, consorting with all kinds of bizarre, deadly monsters. The thing is, this seems to give actual power, if you're perfectly prepared and willing to sink to any depth of excess. They're even rumored to eat Star God brains."
  STR_OLD_EARTH_VOODOO_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Evaluating the worth of these ancient books for our operation is going to be tough. Take this one for example. It's titled War and Peace, but while reading it, I couldn't help but notice it is not about peace at all. And the war parts do not provide any useful information on military technology or tactics! Still, a lot of the other brainerz want to read it, too. Well, I guess you cannot judge a book by its cover. Oh, that reminds me why I've asked you here Cap'n! Some of these thinner books with lots of pictures in them have very intriguing covers. It seems that in ancient times, there was a tribe of mighty voodoo handlers that for some inexplicable reasons wore their underwear on the outside. We should definitely take a closer look at those zines - as we brainerz call them. Maybe we can use their voodoo for our purposes."
  STR_PSI_LAB_UFOPEDIA: "We have gained a basic understanding of the art of magic. Voodoo Power of all Hands is visible now."

  STR_PSI_INITIATION_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "Whether it was secret knowledge or sheer preseverance, you managed to endure the harsh Theban Desert and find the cave, where the Witch of the Golden Rose dwells. It is located inside a canyon, and considering the remoteness, you doubt it is her only dwelling. But how does she come and go? She flies on a broom, maybe? You tighten the grip on your weapon and enter."
  STR_PSI_INITIATION_UFOPEDIA: "The inside of the cave looks more like a palace, but you cannot see clearly, as the heavy smell of autumn flowers makes your head spin and vision blur.{NEWLINE}'Another student, how nice!', a queer voice surprises you. 'I'm the Witch of the Golden Rose, and I just love teaching lovely young girls like you the secrets of wielding Shadowtech. Here, let me help you out of your clothing...' The witch continues: 'Do not be afraid, this is not a classrom. This is only about making your body compatible. The process has already started with the poison I gave you in that tea.' She bursts into soft laugh.{NEWLINE}(New Transformation: Weirdgal)"
  STR_PSI_EXCESS_UFOPEDIA: "While Church priests use the mind-magic of the Star Gods to some degree, the real nature of their sorcery is very, very different. Only our own forays into the realm of decadence allowed us to understand it. Embracing the Excess, one does not rely on trickery - she pursues physical and mental magnificence, thus dispatching hapless enemies with her initiative, intensity, elegance and agility."
  STR_PSI_ILLUSION_UFOPEDIA: "The Academy mages - and the Star Gods themselves - wield magical force that manipulates information. It can be used to play tricks, alter minds, become invisible, etc. - let your imagination run wild! To actually master their most fabled power, the power to control one's mind, we need to better know our physiology, and interrogate an Academy Provost."
  STR_PSI_DESTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "There's no shortage in destructive power delivered by technology. Yet, the same science of death can be further augmented, in some fields, by treading the sorcerous path of Destruction. It can be used to sharpen one's killing instincts, but the greatest power lies in directing the flow of energy: naturally-occurring energy of elements can be tapped and hurled towards enemies, or the energy of enemy attacks can be dissipated by enhanced armor (plasma energy will prove the most troublesome). We'll also need actual combat tech before we can enhance it."
  STR_PSI_COMMUNION_UFOPEDIA: "This sorcerous path of Reticulan origin emphasizes cooperation, growth and acceptance, both in mental as well as physical aspects. While its practices are disgusting to some, or downright creepy, others say that the power of love conquers all, and unity leads to immortality. While I have my doubts, it seems this kind of VooDoo has the greatest potential to counter Star Gods' trickery."
  STR_GLAMOUR_UFOPEDIA: "There is a strange, intangible force to human connections; a force that can give one a power of allure over the masses, a force to sway their hearts that cannot be measured by gold, sorcery nor violence. Well, at least it has been intangible until now, for we were able to pinpoint it, and it will serve our interests!"
  STR_HYPERWAVE_MYSTICISM_UFOPEDIA: "Hyperwaves travel a dimension underlying the whole of reality. They are utilized by Star God tech and even Shadowtech. What knowledge could we gain from learning how to perceive hyperwaves, using our mystical senses? It might not help us with fighting Star God machines, but I feel there are possibilities unknown even to them. What if different dimensions and realities can be accessed, at least on a mental level? We do know about the existence of gates leading to what appears to be such alternate realities - possibly even the Shadowtech comes from such a place?"
  STR_LOVE_MAGIC_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We can use VooDoo to heal, of course! Healing is always a miracle, in a sense, and a properly motivated patient, who has the will to live, goes a long way! This profound understaning came upon us, so to speak, from reading our Codex."
  STR_THE_POWER_OF_SLIME_UFOPEDIA: "After reading Purple Bloom's Cooking Recipes very carefully, I came to a sudden realization that we and the Slime - the nukage under our Hideout - are one and the same. It flows through us, similarly to how the Zombie Juice flows inside Zombies. And as such, we could summon Slime Powers of both dissolution and regeneration in battle. To this end we need to develop Magitech which would help our bodies produce Slime rapidly enough for such a use."
  STR_CHRONOMANCY_UFOPEDIA: "We figured out how to measure time, but can I make it run slower so I won't have to worry about tomorrow? Can I make it go faster to wind through bad times? Can I go back in time to fix my failures? What would I do, if only I had more time left?{NEWLINE}As it turns out, the flow of time can be altered, if only locally; it can be slowed, sped up, even, in some aspects, reversed. It cannot only be stopped. Time waits for no-one..."
  STR_ENTROPOMANCY_UFOPEDIA: "This frightening VooDoo discipline deals with disrupting the very fabric of reality itself. It can be employed to destroy enemies with Warp damage, to protect ourselves with Disruptor (Purple) Shields, and even possibly to open gates to different dimensions. Manifested effects are puny so far, but I'm sure we can take our experiments further with a Summoning Circle."
  STR_VAMPIRISM_UFOPEDIA: "To dance in the moonlight-{NEWLINE}To drink the blood of victims-{NEWLINE}To never grow old or weak-{NEWLINE}How truly excellent!{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}(Only weapons that do not use ammo - like melee - are a proper conduit to vampiric powers)"
  STR_VOICES_OF_THE_DEAD_UFOPEDIA: "We have listened long and intently to the Hyperwaves... and, you won't believe it, we can totally hear the dead speaking through it! I mean, we cannot understand them, but we're pretty sure they're ghosts of dead people. We have even been able to repeat some of the rituals referenced in our Library's books, and we have written down the results. This is so scary, and exciting!{NEWLINE}(Esoterica obtained)"
  STR_DEMONIC_RITUALS_UFOPEDIA: "Dabbling into the dark magics, we have discovered a way for Demonic Essence to be gained through ritual sacrifice in a Summoning Circle. {NEWLINE}Yes it does involve cold-blooded murder of defenceless slaves, was that unclear, Cap'n?! Don't blame the scientist!"
  STR_MOST_COMMON_POWER_UFOPEDIA: "While the gals got all preoccupied with the male superheroes of Old Earth, the more diligent minds studied the superheroines as well. And a startling finding was made - judging by the looks of it, their superpowers seem to be directly related to the size of their chests. The gals do not lack in that department, but some catalysts and knowledge are needed before we can unleash these powers upon the unsuspecting world! The picture should provide us with some pointers."
  STR_PIRATEY_LINGERIE_UFOPEDIA: "The elites hold that Durathread clothing is unfashionable and should be only used for menial work, while expensive designer underwear ranges from flimsy to edible, easily torn to keep the sales going. The end result is, most people can't afford panties. Let's use that market niche to sell our own designs, using Durathread, industrial assembly and imagination, to make underwear that is comfortable, dependable and lasts a lifetime! And our guns will protect us from their 'free market economy'.{NEWLINE}A Library is needed as design bureau. 500 points awarded."
  STR_SWIMSUIT_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Why are swimsuits so stylish and practical? The secret has to do with them being custom made for each gal, with a color scheme to fit her best.{NEWLINE}We'll need to run field tests to ascertain the perfomance of this kind of clothing, if we haven't done that yet."
  STR_BIKINI_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Just like Swimsuits, the Bikinis need to be personalized; and even more distincly so, since there is so little material to work with! This discovery definitely brings us one step closer to mastering the so-called Most Common Superpower.{NEWLINE}We'll need to run field tests to ascertain the perfomance of this kind of clothing, if we haven't done that yet."
  STR_PLOTTING_DESCRIPTION: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Our skills of trickery and distraction are peerless! Some of our nefarius plots have reached fruition! We have clandestinely obtained $100,000 and thus increased our Infamy by 100."
  STR_PLOTTING_UFOPEDIA: "Mutant porn is great and all, but the plot in it is rather often, ugh... lacking substance. So, we suddenly had this idea: what if we cut some porn mags to smaller pieces and then use these pieces to make a better story? So we did, and I'm telling you, it was worth it! Now girls who want to read it must wait for their turn for weeks...!{NEWLINE}So what of it? Thing is, we picked up many ideas on how to analyse information and hatch masterplans..."
  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_SMALL_UFOPEDIA: "Used to power low-performance ships. We can dismantle it to recover its internal Hellerium supply (10) and other parts (2x Plastasteel, 4x SC Wire)"
  STR_EM_JAMMER_UFOPEDIA: "This device is what makes it impossible to discern exact shape of Humanist ships through visual means, as well as more difficult to target them with weapons. It modulates the electromagnetic field around the ship to create an opaque field of plasma. I believe we could replicate this technology to make our ships harder to hit as well, if we understand enough about the nature of magnetism. We cannot use the device directly, as it has to be attuned to ship's hull properties."
  STR_RET_FUSION_REACTOR_UFOPEDIA: "A strange device used by the Reticulans to power their ships. Instead of Hellerium, it uses some nasty substance called 'liquid deuterium'. The overall performance seems to be much inferior to that of Hellerium-fired Ship Engines, and it's hard to tell how abundant this 'liquid deuterium' is, so we don't expect to get a good market price on these devices."
  STR_SECTOWEED_UFOPEDIA: "Smoking this plant makes you all comfy-like and you're not bothered by the pain all that much. The Reticulans, or Sectoids, are the masters of growing funky stuff like this."
  STR_SECFLOWER_UFOPEDIA: "This rare flower of fabled healing properties is grown by the Reticulans. Eating it raw restores 3 Health at the cost of 25 Morale. Works only on the user, regardless of GUI messages."
  STR_APPLE_UFOPEDIA: "We've discovered a legend that Old Earth people were using this strange fruit to construct their most sophisticated electronics. The story turned out to be a hoax - when we connected the apple to standard superconductive electrodes and engaged high voltage, it exploded and covered the whole room with fine mash. By brilliantly not cleaning it up, we've found out it undergoes fermentation! No it totally wasn't laziness!"
  STR_ORANGE_UFOPEDIA: "I'm afraid that if it wasn't about oranges, this avenue of research would be completely fruitless."
  STR_EVIL_GRASS_UFOPEDIA: "This usually docile grass grows in many parts of the world. It doesn't normally pose a threat, but when disturbed by grazing animals (or landing of a ship, for that matter) it tries to snare any mobile lifeforms with its strong, flexible strands. It doesn't pose a real threat to anyone, unless you doze off for many hours in it and let yourself be digested. In battle conditions, the Evil Grass slows down movement. I suggest using explosives - take that, Grass!"
  STR_MUTANT_MEAT_UFOPEDIA: "Juicy, tasty and crunchy! Sure brings memories of our ol' sietch, doesn't it, Cap'n? I suggest taking a few fer a mission, just to keep them spirits high! Meat will replenish 5 Health, 50 Morale and 50 Energy, but will make you sleepy, so wash it down with some water or Rum!{NEWLINE}Reduces Freshness by 15.{NEWLINE}The medical effect works only on oneself."
  STR_MUTANT_FISH_UFOPEDIA: "Mutant Fish shares the healing qualities of Mutant Meat. It is less nutritional but easier to swallow. Note: hitting someone's face with a fish is a highly humiliating gesture.{NEWLINE}Reduces Freshness by 12.{NEWLINE}The medical effect works only on oneself."
  STR_MUTANT_EGG_UFOPEDIA: "Eating it raw is so good for you that it restores 2 HP. Beware of the chicken.{NEWLINE}Reduces Freshness by 9.{NEWLINE}The medical effect works only oneself."

  STR_ETHEREAL_MEAL_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Sell value: 44k"
  STR_CAKE_UFOPEDIA: "This foodstuff is so insanely good that I think I got instantly hooked on it! Not only it does taste like heaven (thus fully restoring morale on use), it also has a great effect on both the body (instant +20 HP boost) and mind (helps with Reactions and Bravery improvement).{NEWLINE}Works only on oneself. It's too delicious to share!"
  STR_BOOT_UFOPEDIA: "Useless, decaying piece of footwear. It doesn't even have a matching other boot. Curses!"
  STR_SKULL_UFOPEDIA: "A humanoid skull. With horns.{NEWLINE}It has been found that holding and caressing such a trophy causes what can only be called 'bloodlust'. A gal taking it into battle will regain 2 extra Energy per turn, at the cost of 1 Morale. Multiples stack."
  STR_AMPHORE_UFOPEDIA: "A piece of ancient, decorative ceramics. That somehow makes it much more valuable than brand-new pieces of ceramics.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 500"
  STR_ANKH_UFOPEDIA: "An ancient symbol of life, cast into gold. Fertility or immortality, which one does it mean to you? Or maybe both?{NEWLINE}Sell value: 50k"
  STR_GOLDEN_CUP_UFOPEDIA: "Probably not the Holy Grail. Have you drunk your fill?{NEWLINE}Sell value: 75k"
  STR_GOLDEN_CROSS_UFOPEDIA: "An old symbol of religious materialism. Can be exchanged for mundane, immaterial money.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 110k"
  STR_CROWN_UFOPEDIA: "Opulent headgear, made for some long-forgotten monarch. You can wear it in front of your mirror to boost your ego.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 240k"
  STR_JUNK_PILE_UFOPEDIA: "The centuries-old debris that is laying all over our hideout seems to contain useful materials (per item: 15 Scrap Metal, 10 Chemicals, 1 Superconductive Wire... and who knows what else?) We can retrieve them, if only we manage to force them Runts to spend some time rummaging through the mess. We might even make them mine real tunnels, if we also have pickaxes and torches."
  STR_HITAYATE_UFOPEDIA: "Ninjas wear these things as the symbol of their affiliation. Jack is paying for them 15 Bounty Tokens apiece, as long as they're undamaged."
  STR_MERC_BIZCARD_UFOPEDIA: "These virtually indestructible business cards, made of plastasteel, are carried by some Mercenaries as badges of honor. Recovering these cards as trophies will bring us some Infamy.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 5,000"
  STR_RING_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy, silver ring, adorned with a small jewel. As the name implies, used to sign documents by people too rich and important to be bothered not only by personal computers, but even ink and paper.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 3,000"
  STR_MEDALLION_UFOPEDIA: "Made of precious metal and gems, not extremely valuable due to low mass, but quite inspiring workmanship-wise. Wearing it will lessen a gal's Combat Stress by 1, but such vanity makes one lose her focus, and thus her Time Units will be reduced by 2 in turn. Multiples stack.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 6,500"
  STR_COINS_UFOPEDIA: "Old bullion, made of precious metals and embossed with arcane signs and pictures of assorted loons. Can be exchanged for modern money, likely with a loss.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 11k"
  STR_DOLLAR_BRIEFCASE_UFOPEDIA: "A bag laden with legendary green paper Dolaros. They're not accepted as currency anymore, but can be sold to the Cultists of Dollar for religious use.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 25k"
  STR_COIN_CHEST_UFOPEDIA: "A chest full of gleaming coins of the Old World.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 350k"
  STR_LOOTBOX_PREPPER_UFOPEDIA: "This box contains some half-decent weapons, medicines and a single Guns n' Ammo magazine."
  STR_LOOTBOX_OLD_EARTH_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "This very old and beaten-up box appears mostly intact. We expect to find at least some functional weapons inside. If we're lucky, they will be weapons of some rare kind."
  STR_LOOTBOX_SMUGGLER_UFOPEDIA: "Used by Smugglers to transport valuable contraband. Protected by an electronic lock and set to destroy contents if tampered with (which just happened, by the way). So breaking in takes some time, as well as Workshop and Lab. It still comes with some risk of breaking what's inside."
  STR_LOOTBOX_ARCANE_UFOPEDIA: "This heavily reinforced box is usually used by Mages to ship dangerous and forbidden artifacts. It is protected by a powerful VooDoo curse, but this is also its weakness - with the help of a Summoning Circle and enough time invested in rituals, we can convince this Sesame to open itself. A Library will be needed as well, for references."
  STR_JADE_URN_UFOPEDIA: "In the right, I mean wrong, hands, this magic powder can help to summon a powerful demon! Or even open a gate to the demon world! Wololo!{NEWLINE}Sell value: 24k"
  STR_CREDIT_CHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The most popular means of physical money transportation and storage, at least in the 'civilized' parts of the planet. Worth anywhere between 200 and 20000 Dolaros ($). There are (downplayed by the Guild) rumors about these chips being hackable, at least up to the Silver level, but nothing substantial. The Lokk'Naars are willing to give us the full Dolaros value in exchange, so either they don't know about these rumors, or they do know and have some plan on how to profit on them."
  STR_CREDIT_CHIP_C_UFOPEDIA: "The Guild and the Govts have been long discussing pros and cons of introducing a $100 credit chip. Values of mobility were weighed against security, various tribunes of public interests clashed with black knights of corporate greed, all to no avail. Well, until now. Our sucking up to all these fools was not in vain. We have managed to win a political campaign to introduce this new, promising coin! See how its cheap plastic gleams?{NEWLINE}The blueprints should already be awaiting you in your Mint, Cap'n!{NEWLINE}Oh, and - any plans for tonight?"
  STR_GOLD_CRACK_UFOPEDIA: "It was no small task, Cap'n, but we managed to ultimately crack the gold-level security protocols that protect data on the namesake $20k Credit Chips. Huzzah for the literal showers of money we can now forge!!!"
  STR_OBSIDIAN_CRACK_UFOPEDIA: "With the humming of our Computer Core audible even here, it's not surprising we've become the masters of money manipulation. Obsidian Chips can now be broken down into Golden ones for stratospherical profit, although we'll need an Industrial Printer installed beside our Mint. And acquire physical Gold for the chips, too."
  STR_ECONOMIC_FUNDAMENTALS_UFOPEDIA: "From now on, we can mint our own Obsidian Chips. Industrial Printer and Power Plant are needed to support a Mint which is doing this. We also need a lump of Ore for each Chip - even we can't make them out of thin air!"
  STR_SILVER_BAR_UFOPEDIA: "A standardized chunk of heavy, malleable metal, less valuable than gold, both in financial alchemy and the ordinary one ($17.5k)."
  STR_GOLD_BAR_UFOPEDIA: "A standardized chunk of heavy, malleable metal, which can be exchanged for $40k worth of goods & services."

  STR_MONEY_PURSE_UFOPEDIA: "A purse laden with coins. Me likey.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 60k"
  STR_CASH_BAG_UFOPEDIA: "Filled with a ton of various coins. We have counted them and concluded it's best to do so before selling it.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 200k"
  STR_SAFE_UFOPEDIA: "A safe full of money.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 1M"
  STR_GOLDEN_HELM_UFOPEDIA: "An ornamental helm, present on all the big Guild vessels. More than anything else, it symbolizes the power of the Guild: mastery of the sea (space transportation), winds (information) and trade. Its eight directions embody freedom of movement and endless opportunities. The opulence of the whole thing represents, obviously, wealth.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 5M"
  STR_NUCLEAR_MATERIALS_UFOPEDIA: "Ancient fission weapons are banned and there is no fissionable material to be found on Earth. This lead-laden briefcase clearly doesn't exist.{NEWLINE}Sell value: 375k"
  STR_NUCLEAR_BATT_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy-duty electrical battery with highly suspect fissionable material inside. Can provide a hundred years worth of power, but also invite wrath of the Star Gods, as they seem to hate any sort of such technology. But who would use it anyway, with Hellerium being so cheap and plentiful?{NEWLINE}Sell value: 50k"
  STR_RANGEFINDER_UFOPEDIA: "It is used to find range to the target, d'oh.{NEWLINE}(Just use the 'Aimed Shot' option to point the device at it)."
  STR_OCCULAR_UFOPEDIA: "A very advanced and sophisticated device that lets you quickly analyse an enemy who's within your sights. It is able to record and store huge amounts of information."
  STR_LIGHT_CRYSTAL_UFOPEDIA: "This rare and curious device produces light so bright it can illuminate a gravball stadium yet it is not blinding anyone. Must be magic!"
  STR_CRYSTAL_SKULL_UFOPEDIA: "There are very few legends that cross over cultures and times the way the crystal skull legends do. They are contemporarily shared by indigenous people all around the world. These legends have been handed down from generation to generation for thousands of years, which attests to their enduring power. It is said each skull contains '13 spirits of power', imprisoned into the skull even before any human or mutant existed.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Crystal skulls give the user mastery over Time itself, if the spirits are sated with time taken away from others: 50% of damage dealt while wielding it will be returned as Time Units (if the target is susceptible to Mind damage). The Skull can be also used to read minds. The price for that power is heavy, as usage might lead to insanity or even death."
  STR_HOLY_HANDGRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "And the LORD spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.' {NEWLINE} - Book of Armaments, Chapter 2, verses 9-21"
  STR_SIVALINGA_UFOPEDIA: "Sivalinga Stones are sacred healing stones. On one hand you see the masculine part of the stone within its phallic shape, and the feminine as well in the egg shape, and in the beauty of the markings on the stones. The stone as a whole recognizes that they are one, yet they are each a separate entity within the one. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Sivalinga Stones will intensify the vitality and level of pranic energy within your body if you are fatally wounded. To improve your overall health these stones are powerful as they stimulate the energy system of the entire body, and will aid an overall improvement in your health and well-being (7 health per heal). However, the proper application of the stone is very tiring to the healer."
  STR_TORCH_UFOPEDIA: "Throw it on the ground to provide night-time lighting. Alternatively, smash nasty types with it to set them on fire (deals 5-10 Fire damage and incurs Morale and TU losses). The terrain won't catch fire from it. I'm sure there is a scientific explanation to this phenomenon. Putting a lit torch in your inventory is, however, still impossible.{NEWLINE}Melee Attack: Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 80%, 12 TUs){NEWLINE}>WARNING: Throwing a Torch has a 50% chance to extinguish it."
  STR_MAG_LITE_UFOPEDIA: "This weighty piece of machinery provides the best in illuminating your surroundings in dark conditions. It can be also used to bash heads in.{NEWLINE}Stun = 15+STR*0.5; Skill = MA/2+50, Acc = 65%, 10 TUs)>WARNING: There is a 25% chance of breaking the Mag Lite when you throw it."
  STR_UTILITY_EQUIPMENT_UFOPEDIA: "In here we have gathered information about all manner of gear that cannot really be called weapons, nor is used for healing or protection, but serves other important functions: to gather intelligence, to illuminate the battlefield, to obscure your movements to the enemy, to dig tunnels, to put out the fires, etc."
  STR_MEDICAL_STUFF_UFOPEDIA: "This section covers the plethora of equipment used to mend wounds, heal Stun damage, restore Energy and even Morale. Some of these allow healing others, some allow to heal yourself, some both. Be careful to not confuse whom you're healing, the target is chosen in the following order: 1) someone you're standing on; 2) someone you're facing; 3) yourself."
  STR_PROTECTIVE_GEAR_UFOPEDIA: "To resist elements, one solution is to wear the right kind of armor, but there is no time to change armor in combat. A more flexible approach is the use of Protective Gear.{NEWLINE}These items only need to be carried anywhere in warrior's equipment to be active (but start to work only the next half-turn after equipping). Effects of these items stack, unless they occupy the same Gear Slot. They have 2 stats:{NEWLINE}>Effectivity: by what factor armor's Resistance is changed (the worse armor, the better gain); {NEWLINE}>Max Resistance: the item, combined with armor, can improve resistance only that far, so wearing it with armor which already gives better or equal resistance is pointless."    
  STR_SHAWL_UFOPEDIA: "This piece of clothing not only makes you look cool when standing in the cold wind, it also makes you feel less cold when doing so. Reduces the effects of Cold damage by 1/4, up to 50% final Resistance. It can be used to choke enemies as well, similarly to the Rope, but less effectively.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Any"
  STR_FUR_HAT_UFOPEDIA: "A type of a traditional fur hat, worn in the Arctic regions. This particular one is made of rare fur, so it can fetch quite a price. Reduces the effects of Cold damage by 1/7, up to 50% final Resistance.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Hat"
  STR_A_SPACE_TOWEL_UFOPEDIA: "When all seems lost, just grab onto it and read what it says! You'll be surprised how useful it can be. A best-selling item amongst smart people all over the Galaxy - just like the famous Hitchhiker's Guide says! Now in elegant black! Can be yours for a low, low price!{NEWLINE}Reduces the effects of Cold AND Hot damage by 1/5, up to 50% final Resistance. When present in the inventory, it also regenerates 3 Morale per turn (yes, holding it in your hand counts - how else would you keep it on during all the movement?).{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Any"
  STR_FAN_UFOPEDIA: "An exotic stun weapon which will also help you to survive in hot climate (counts as Protective Gear). Reduces the effects of Heat damage by 1/10, up to 30% final Resistance. Hitting enemies with the Fan humiliates them.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Tool"
  STR_THERMAL_SHIRT_UFOPEDIA: "Superconductive wires intertwined with Durathread lattice efficiently dissipate bodily heat, thus increasing resistance to Heat, which, as far as I know, is a crucial problem in all sorts of enviro-sealed suits. The Shirt helps to regenerate 3 Energy per turn, and it reduces the effects of Heat damage by 1/4, up to 30% final Resistance.{NEWLINE}The Shirt also slightly improves resistance to Plasma (1/10 reduction, up to 50%){NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Torso"
  STR_LIQUID_COOL_UFOPEDIA: "A can of a super-effective cooling agent. Just having it in your inventory reduces the effects of Heat damage by 20%, but the intense cold drains 2 Energy per turn. Drinking it is NOT advised, as it will cause 9 Health damage; it will, however, restore 300 Energy and 10 Freshness (works only on oneself).{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Tool"
  STR_GAS_MASK_UFOPEDIA: "Carried anywhere in your equipment, it reduces the effects of any Choking damage you take by 2/3. If your resistance to that type of damage is already 50% or better, it has no further effect.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Hat"
  STR_AY_GOGGLES_UFOPEDIA: "Safety first, and protecting face and eyes is always important! Wearing these will reduce the effects of any Chem damage you take by 1/10, even after your helmet has melted. If your resistance to that type of damage is already 50% or better, they will have no further effect. Might not be much, but better than nothing. Also, having access to these will help us with dangerous experiments!{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Jewelry/Hat"
  STR_CHEM_COAT_UFOPEDIA: "Tired of acid rain? Use this little wonder of chemical industry! Reduces the effects of Chem damage by 1/4th, up to maximum Resist of 50%{NEWLINE}In addition to this effect, the Coat adds 2 Morale per turn.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Torso"

  STR_LINGERIE_UFOPEDIA: "We have procured this... well, we all know the story. I'm not sure what practical purpose this does serve, but it looks really snappy - if not too comfy.{NEWLINE}When kept in inventory, it increases defense against Charm damage by 1/4, up to maximum Resistance of 30%.{NEWLINE}Improves Morale recovery by 2/turn.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Torso"

  STR_LUNAR_WARD_UFOPEDIA: "A silvery symbol of the Moon and the Star, radiating a faint light. The thaumaturgical field it emanates protects against direct damage done by Mind attacks (but doesn't affect the chance of them being successful).{NEWLINE}Reduces the effects of Mind damage taken by 1/5, with no maximum resistance limit.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Jewelry{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The Lunar Ward also increases Morale recovery by 2 per turn. This effect stacks."
  STR_BEJEWELED_CAP_UFOPEDIA: "This thin golden cap, made in an exquisite form, protects the wearer's valuable cerebrum from harmful mind waves.{NEWLINE}Reduces the effects of Mind damage taken by 1/3, with no maximum resistance limit. Does not reduce the chance of a mental attack working.{NEWLINE}In addition, reduces the effects of Daze damage by 1/10, to a maximum Resistance of 30%.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Hat{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The Bejeweled Cap also increases Morale recovery by 3 and Stun recovery by 2 per turn. These effects stack."
  STR_GOLDEN_STATUE_UFOPEDIA: "This statue, made of solid gold, deciphers a 'Golden Sait' in very close detail. So close, in fact, that we were able to guesstimate the combat analysis of this avatar of Shadowmasters. It was not easy, though, as the statue holds immense alluring power, hence the research progressed slowly due to numerous... breaks. Speaking of breaks, there is a way to break this charm: we must ritually break the statue up. This simple yet profound realization was truly groundbreaking."
  STR_AVATAR_MEDALLION_UFOPEDIA: "This medallion bears the symbol of entropy: the universal force that decays any order into chaos. The erosion of a planet, the cooling of a star, the explosion of a bomb, the bug in a code, the torn hole in your pants. This force seems to be the sign of Shadowmasters and the one thing Star Gods fear the most. As for the medallion itself, it vibrates with dreadful energies. I believe we can make some further use of it, once our understanding of the true nature of all things deepens.{NEWLINE}On the immediately practical side, wearing this medallion will reduce any Warp damage taken by 1/4, with no resistance limit (Gear Slot: Jewelry)"
  STR_BLACK_MASK_UFOPEDIA: "An ominous looking mask, undoubtedly belonging to some dark cult. We have divined that it has some interesting properties:{NEWLINE}Reduces the effects of Mind damage taken by 1/4, with no maximum resistance limit. Does not reduce the chance of a mental attack working.{NEWLINE}It also reduces damage caused by Chem, Electricity, Fire, Daze and Bio by 1/10 each, to a maximum Resistance of 50/30/30/30/10% respectively.{NEWLINE}However, it makes you feel exhausted and saps 8 Energy per turn.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Hat"
  STR_GRAV_DAMPER_UFOPEDIA: "This device employs antigravity to stabilize the bearer and thus protect them against Concussive damage. Reduces such damage effects by 1/4, up to a maximum Resistance of 30%{NEWLINE}Fairly heavy, and requires Industrial Printer to be made.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Belt"
  STR_ZORTRIUM_JACKET_UFOPEDIA: "A wearable piece of extra armor, made from a thin layer of magical Zortrium. It decreases effects of most types of direct damage (Piercing, Stabbing, Slashing, Laser, Plasma) by roughly 1/5, and even gives some resistance against Concussive damage.{NEWLINE}Gear Slot: Torso"
  STR_LEVITATOR_UFOPEDIA: "A standalone anti-grav unit, designed to be worn on a person. It doesn't grant the ability to fly, but decreases effective encumbrance by 15. Be careful where you put it - they have the tendency to end up in strange places!{NEWLINE}Wearing a Levitator is a tumultous experience, therefore each one equipped drains 1 Freshness per turn."
  STR_ENERGY_SHIELD_SMALL_UFOPEDIA: "This is a Red energy shield with 133 hit points worth of charge. It protects the wielder when held in either hand. As its charge depletes, it will go dark. Requires Power Plant to manufacture.{NEWLINE}Burnout in 8 Turns."
  STR_REFRACTOR_SHIELD_SMALL_UFOPEDIA: "This is a Gold energy shield with 200 hit points worth of charge. It protects the wielder when held in either hand, but needs to be activated first. It quickly degenerates (rate of 15), but it doesn't mean much as it burnouts even quicker.{NEWLINE}Burnout in 1.5 Turns."
  STR_ARCANE_SHIELD_SMALL_UFOPEDIA: "This is a Blue energy shield with 150 hit points worth of charge. It protects the wielder when held in either hand, but needs to be activated first. It won't hold the charge forever, though; it degerates at a rate of 7. Requires Computer Core (or Lab) to manufacture.{NEWLINE}Burnout in 3.5 Turns."
  STR_ENERGY_MATRIX_SMALL_UFOPEDIA: "This is a Purple energy shield with 100 hit points worth of charge. It protects the wielder when held in either hand. It regenerates its charge at a rate of 9. Where does the energy for that come from? Another dimension!  Requires Summoning Circle to manufacture.{NEWLINE}Burnout in 11.5 Turns."
  STR_TREASURE_CHEST_UFOPEDIA: "This box contains a heap of gold and a single gem of each type. So where are they now? Science demands sacrifices, didn't you know?{NEWLINE}Sell value: 500k"
  STR_MUTON_MERCENARY_RECEIPT_UFOPEDIA: "These are dispensed by the Merc Security for each mission they participate in. Relying on Mercs means they will steal our own thunder; each Receipt costs us -50 Infamy in a mission."
  STR_MYSTERY_BOX_UFOPEDIA: "We only know this box was handed out by the 'Giftmasters', and that it defies any attempts of scanning or breaking it. We already figured out that opening it is as easy (or as hard) as simply convincing it to do so, using your inner VooDoo voice and Hyperwave mystic ear. The box seems to be kind of a one-way, single-use portal that can bring something to our dimension. The box whispers that it can contain either riches or disasters. (We'd better have excess storage space to ensure we can handle its contents; it could transport here a whole country for all we know). So, when do we open it?"
  STR_DREAM_ECHO_UFOPEDIA: "These floating lights can be found throughout the Shadowrealm; when touched, they bestow blurry, dreamlike, fragmentary visions. These visions, however, may contain useful knowledge for someone versed in Hyperwave Mystycism. Analysis and interpretation of these Echoes will give us random insights into the Shadowrealm."
  STR_DEMON_HEART_UFOPEDIA: "Beating hearts that can be found in the Shadowrealm. Their true nature or origin is unknown, but it is known that when eaten, they restore 20 Health and Energy. Such a revolting act, however, reduces Morale by 20 (works only on oneself). Sadly, like most items we find in the Shadowrealm, they apparently cannot be taken back to our world."
  STR_ZORTRIUM_CRYSTAL_UFOPEDIA: "This material might be what gives some of the Shadowtech its virtual indestructibility. Any attempts at even scratching the surface of this extremely dense crystal have failed. We estimate that the energies required to break it could likely obliterate a good portion of our hideout. Clearly, Zortrium cannot be forged into anything useful by normal means."
  STR_SLIME_INFESTATION_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This otherworldly slime creature infests our Hideouts, and its sole entertainment seems to be harassing our crew, which severely disrupts our daily workings. It is too elusive to defeat without incinerating the whole Hideout, the only solution yet is luring it out, using Ubers as baits."
  STR_POLTERGEIST_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Our power network is being haunted by an energy being. It lives off electricity and causes malfunctions galore, thus raising our monthly upkeep by $333k. Purging it, however, would be very costly."
  STR_SDD_UFOPEDIA: "This dangerous artifact has a mind of its own, and it is an evil mind. It communicated to us that it detests weakness. If our Hideout gets invaded, and we won't manage to get rid of attackers within 13 turns, it will explode, taking a good chunk of the base with it. Any operation to get rid of it would have to be performed with utmost care lest we rouse its suspicions (and thus will be very costly)."
  STR_TRANSDIMENSIONAL_LOCKER_UFOPEDIA: "Transdimensional Locker is yet another piece of mysterious Shadowtech. It is somehow able to hold items in a dimension different than our own. Once we'll activate it, it will effectively grant us 50 extra storage space."
  STR_GOLDEN_APPLE_UFOPEDIA: "Coveted by Heroes, Sages and Rogues, the Golden Apple is an universal symbol of Discord and its goddess, Eris. Not belonging to any Shadow god in particular, yet being common to all of them, it represents the element of Chaos, the drive to unshackle oneself from everything that binds us and taste the true freedom. Disagreement brings strength and knowledge. Too much agreement invites slavery, corruption and weakness. Armed with such a powerful symbol of independence, we can lure in an exceptional individual to join forces with us."
  STR_SHADOW_ORB_BLUE_UFOPEDIA: "This Orb-tech seems related to interplanar travel and speed in general."
  STR_SHADOW_ORB_GREEN_UFOPEDIA: "This Orb-tech seems related to entropy and space warping, which might make one wielding it harder to hit."
  STR_SHADOW_ORB_MIND_UFOPEDIA: "This Orb-tech seems related to psionics, boosts perception and clairvoyance."
  STR_SHADOW_ORB_RED_UFOPEDIA: "This Orb-tech seems related to energy, strength and power."
  STR_SHADOW_ORB_CRYSTAL_UFOPEDIA: "This Orb-tech seems related to immutability and anti-entropy."
  STR_CODEX_GOLD_UFOPEDIA: "A choice of a Magnificent Queen, the Golden Codex corresponds with concepts of excellence, splendour, fervour and joy, and the element of water. It is an opposite of the Red Codex.{NEWLINE}This option will repair the biggest gun of the Hull, and unlock Captain's Quarters, giving us access to its riches."
  STR_CODEX_GRAY_UFOPEDIA: "A choice of an Insidious Queen, the Gray Codex corresponds with concepts of the unknown, intelligence, magic and exploration, and the element of air. It is an opposite of the Green Codex.{NEWLINE}This option will make the Hull conjure a funky missile launcher, and unlock its library of knowledge (including a manual on VooDoo)... and who knows what else?" 
  STR_CODEX_GREEN_UFOPEDIA: "A choice of a Gentle Queen, the Green Codex corresponds with concepts of endurance, healing, wisdom and hope, and the element of earth. It is an opposite of the Gray Codex.{NEWLINE}This option will provide us with a defensive laser weapon that never runs dry, and unlock the Hull's medical facility. The latter not only contain supplies, but will also somehow give birth to three 'creatures'; rather creepy."
  STR_CODEX_RED_UFOPEDIA: "A choice of a Warrior Queen, the Red Codex corresponds with concepts of law, integrity, destruction and machine, and the element of fire. It is an opposite of the Golden Codex.{NEWLINE}This option will activate a rocket weapon, that can be fed with commonly available Spike rockets. It will also unlock the ship's armory, huzzah!"
  STR_KEYCARD_RED_UFOPEDIA: "These codes, procured from an Academy Provost, are 1/4th of what we require to penetrate Cydonia's defense grid."
  STR_KEYCARD_YELLOW_UFOPEDIA: "These codes, procured from a Guildmaster, are 1/4th of what we require to penetrate Cydonia's defense grid."
  STR_KEYCARD_GREEN_UFOPEDIA: "These codes, procured from a Church Cardinal, are 1/4th of what we require to penetrate Cydonia's defense grid."
  STR_KEYCARD_BLUE_UFOPEDIA: "These codes, along with the three other sets, will ensure that when we arrive at Cydonia, we'll be taken for the Star Gods' special guests."
  STR_INTERSTELLAR_SHIP_PROJECT_UFOPEDIA: "Beating the Solar Governor might be the easiest part. But if it isn't to be a poor-man's suicide mission, we need an interstellar-capable ship, fitted with technology as advanced as possible, to fully free ourselves from being shackled to this planet. We have codenamed it 'CONQUEROR'. Here's a broad outline:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>ROBUST HULL. Not only do we need the best hull tech, but likely also a very large manufacturing facility to house it.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>BIG ENGINE. Star God modular design just won't do, we need a single, big engine for maximum space and fuel efficiency.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>FUEL CELLS. Likewise, we can't haul an enormous fuel tank with us, so some kind of supercharged fuel is our only hope.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>HABITATION. We obviously need to survive inside the ship, in reasonable luxury, and ideally for months at least.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>BRIDGE. Likely the most complex component, the brains of the ship."
  STR_MARS_CAPSULE_PROJECT_UFOPEDIA: "Getting to Mars may be simpler than we think. We just need a huge Hellerium-filled rocket to deliver a small pod to the target, then we, I mean our Hands, can finish off the Solar Governor and hope for the best! Missiles and Space Suits are the key researches to develop such a craft."
  STR_PIRATEZ_BACKGROUND_UFOPEDIA: "Legends say once the Earth was ruled by humans, and there were no mutants at all. Even if such tall tales are true, it is all long gone. Nowadays the planet is just a distant periphery of the huge stellar Empire, ruled by the Star Gods. A poor backwater with corrupt government and brainwashed population, rife with crime - and opportunity. Mutants and outcasts like us are not loved by anyone, so we choose infamy over their sick and unjust order. They may call us pirates and criminals but it's better to die free than live in chains!"
  STR_PIRATEZ_UBERS_UFOPEDIA: "We the Ubers live in zones heavily irradiated by centuries of Hellerium fallout, scattered all over the world. These so-called 'Uber Zones', or simply 'Zones', are avoided by everyone else, in part because radiation is bad for their health, but mostly for the extremely dangerous fauna and flora that lives there that only locals know how to handle or avoid. Of the outsiders, only the zone-savvy 'Stalkers' dare to venture into our Zones, mainly to buy monster hides and sell tech. It is not uncommon for a Black Market's trading post to be located near a Zone, but their prices on most goods are outrageous. For us, leaving Zones for too long is quite lethal; most Ubers get sick and die, and those who survive (known as 'Striders'), lose most of our mutant powers. To safely operate outside of the Zones, we must constantly consume irradiated drinks and food, making us unable to expand territorially even if we wanted to."
  STR_ENVIRO_UFOPEDIA: "It is dangerous for us to leave the Zones, especially if you're unprepared. The most common conditions you will encounter are Heat and Cold, although acid rains aren't unheard of; check your outfits for resistances.{NEWLINE}>Heat. Intense hotness will cause Gals to lose focus and thus accumulate Stun damage, 8 per turn if resistance = 100%. It also deals Freshness damage if her resistance is 80% or worse.{NEWLINE}>Cold. Freezing will drain 10 Energy and inflict 3 Stun per turn. In addition, it will cause 1 HP damage per turn to anyone with Resistance 200% or worse.{NEWLINE}Dangerous environments can be identified by changed map background color."
  STR_CAMOUFLAGE_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Camouflage helps you see before being seen, which is quite important for survival.{NEWLINE}>CAMO: A unit is only visible from a number of tiles closer than spotter's vision range. Two values mean different effectivity at Day/Night.{NEWLINE}>INVIS: Invisibility is something on a different level altogether. These units are only visible from a number of tiles specified, not a tile further.{NEWLINE}>SPOT: Reduces both by its value, can differ Day/Night."
  STR_HEATVISION_UFOPEDIA: "Heat, or thermal vision (ThV) is employed by electronic sights, like those normally used by human carapace and powered armor, but it's also a natural feature of various beasts, aliens and monsters. A unit with Heat Vision ignores a set amount of Smoke (in percentage) for the purpose of spotting. This makes smokescreens less than fully effective against many types of enemies.{NEWLINE}Note that ThV rating only describes behaviour vs. Smoke, not the actual Nightvision range (NV)."
  STR_SOULSENSE_UFOPEDIA: "Soulsense, also called Inner Eye, ESP etc. is an ability to spot living beings through mystical means. It is coded as SENSE, and allows one to see through darkness, smoke and even walls, up to stated range. Naturally, the Star Gods and their magic are known for powerful SENSE, however, some monsters might possess supernatural sense of smell or vibration, or whatever, which also counts as SENSE. Note that SENSE doesn't allow spotting non-sentient beings, like normal robots or droids."
  STR_VIOLENCE_UFOPEDIA: "As it is said, nobody can exist without violence and retain sanity; learning to release violence without losing honor is what makes us civilized. As we do battle, our enemies will do their best to take us down. Ruthless brutality is the most direct answer. We can devise weapons to help with that worthy endeavour, but it is up to you, Cap'n, to hone gals' strength and come up with effective tactics."
  STR_SURVIVAL_UFOPEDIA: "It's a dangerous world out there, and we be needing to learn how to get tougher and live off the land. To achieve that, we need weapons and armor; and preferably such that don't need many resources to be made."
  STR_CUNNING_UFOPEDIA: "Capt'n - I had a stunning realization! Painstakingly crafting every last piece of equipment and machinery makes no sense, if we can just buy stuff on the market! Trading, ho! But to trade, we need to build trust and think faster than our competition. So instead of a legion of things, we developed just a single one to rule them all: we call it X-Grog! Not only can we sell it on the Black Market for a good profit, but also use it to break the ice with the people of Jack's Town. When drunk enough, they should be more trusting towards us!"
  STR_WEIRDNESS_UFOPEDIA: "Problems need to be solved. And the proven combination of strength, dedication and charisma does not always work. That is when you often need to try weird stuff to overcome the problem. Is relying on old solutions viable? How does this or that really work? How much do we really know? Would doing a seemingly dumb thing turn to be a good idea? When you face a reality as weird as we do, getting weird as well might be neccessary. We will need to turn every stone and scrape every piece of information we can lay our hands on. Thankfully, we, the Brainers, are weird by both passion and trade! You wouldn't believe half the strange stuff we discovered about the Lab we've found at our Hideout..."
  STR_DIPLOMACY_DESCRIPTION: "Your diplomatic efforts have substantially increased everyone's opinion on us. Your position is simply implacable, Cap'n...{NEWLINE}[+500 Infamy]"
  STR_DIPLOMACY_UFOPEDIA: "The art of telling someone to sod off in a such way that they'll start to feel a rising excitement about the upcoming journey. With that level of refinement in social technology, we can start to negotiate deals with people who are alien or outright hostile - like, for example, some of our prisoners who'd otherwise endure even the worst tortures... [+1000 Infamy]"
  STR_CIVILIZATION_UFOPEDIA: "We have gained enough cultural and material wealth to call ourselves civilized, and thus created a possibility to better the society and raise the value of human life - should we choose to do so. This is one of the requirements for the Higher Studies project.[2000 points awarded]"
  STR_INTERROGATION_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}It's time for a change of pace at this little cozy hideout. We have the proper tools and knowledge now, and they're GOING TO TELL US EVERYTHING THEY KNOW.{NEWLINE}To make a prisoner ready to talk, you have to run him or her through our little softening-up routine at the Workshop,  in the 'Interrogation' category, marked with an 'I' letter. The poor sods will be naturally stripped of their possessions (you'll see the familiar shorthand info on the material gains, just like with the slavery), but instead of an obedient slave, you'll get a 'Broken' person at the other end. These can be then invited back here, and with enough extra time with me, be sure that any secrets they have hidden until now will be revealed.{NEWLINE}Please take note that to arrange a proper softening-up course, we need to have completed a normal interrogation of their peer first, you didn't expect everything on the first date, did you?"
  STR_EMANCIPATION_UFOPEDIA: "Slavery is the curse of our times. Slavery builds economies, but at some point it becomes obsolete next to the power we get from machines. We can now educate and equip our slaves to send them into the world as free people and spread the civilization. This will cost us money and time, but the free flow of ideas will grant us new knowledge and cultural influence."
  STR_FEUDALISM_UFOPEDIA: "Our power and influence have grown greatly. No more we can consider ourselves a mere band of pirates. Now we're seen as champions, living legends, archvillains, potentates, lords - all these things mean we're expected to act the part. After all, you crowned yourself as Queen, and nobility obliges. When you have grown strong, won your freedom, you stop thinking of immediate survival and profit, like a common coward, and your mind turns to higher things, like your legacy. This power gives us privilege to show mercy and accept this burden. Or release our wrath and drown this world in chaos.{NEWLINE}(+500 Infamy)"
  STR_STARDOM_UFOPEDIA: "I had a vision, Cap'n - let's aim for the very top and become world-class idols! With enough popularity, we can have everything, criminals turned warriors of love!{NEWLINE}[10,000 Pts. Awarded]"
  STR_PIMPCRAFT_UFOPEDIA: "It ain't nearly as easy as it looks. To keep both the staff and customers happy, while retaining discipline, and some sort of dignity - it takes willpower, charisma and proper swag.{NEWLINE}We can now either manufacture our own Mutant Porn (the actors will be set free after a session), or make captured Hoes (and similarly inclined captives) work for us as Courtesans, who earn us $20k monthly while occupying prison space."
  STR_PERSUASION_UFOPEDIA: "Honed persuasive powers will allow us to interrogate VIPs and broaden our slavery and recruitment options."
  STR_SALVAGE_UFOPEDIA: "Yes, it's a shady business, but you don't have to indulge in it, and these people were already slaves to the Star Gods anyway. Will you be a kinder master than them, Cap'n? The Slavery option is available in the Workshop, and it permanently turns a prisoner into a slave. A slave is worth less money than a pristine hostage, but will generate monthly income and storage space through the power of human networking. He or she will also be relieved of their possessions, just like through Robbery. Some people are mentally unfit to be used as slaves - they'd be more trouble than help."
  STR_UNDERGROUND_HUNTING_UFOPEDIA: "It was never a secret that some things be living in the radioactive sludge beneath our hideout. We used to fear them, but we know better now! If we send properly equipped Runts into the caves, they should, probably, likely return with some catches, like meat, chitin and maybe even a rare geode. We need an Extractor present to undertake this enterprise."
  STR_FARMING_UFOPEDIA: "Farming is the fine art of putting things in the ground, waiting for a bit, then pulling out food. Which is much more complicated than it sounds, especially underground! You need to adjust moisture levels, light intensity, Hellerium levels... Yeah, the same Hellerium, from the Extractor. It takes uber-fertilizer to grow uber-veggies to feed us uber-gals!"
  STR_CUISINE_UFOPEDIA: "Soylent not good. Meat good. Prime cuts not only can raise morale, but also fetch us some hefty prices on the market. Once them damned Runts learn to cook... in the literal, not obliteral, sense of the word. Which sounds like a real challenge... but definitely worth risking the kitchen being blown up a few times."
  STR_FORGERY_UFOPEDIA: "Procuring data on how the banking and government transactions work, as well as making some contact with criminals, we were able to come up with a way to forge money, using generally-available human ID cards. However, to get the printing press going, we have yet to figure out how to make a proper mint."
  STR_MENAGERIE_UFOPEDIA: "In addition to warriors with names, faces and opinions, we can employ blindly loyal savage beasts to do our bidding in battle. These beasts require 'Auxiliary' cargo space in our vessels, and will never gain combat experience. Any injuries they suffer do not matter to us, and they're instantly ready for the next fight no matter how badly wounded they were in the last one. They do not require constant supervision of handlers, but they need to be held at a Burrow or an equivalent building."
  STR_XENO_TAMING_UFOPEDIA: "A step up from taming familiar creatures, it only required boldly coming where no woman has gone before!{NEWLINE}Of course, besides boldness, proper techniques are required, mainly to convince the xeno you're not food: certain ways of touching, sounds, movement, smell, treats, appearance. Yes, sometimes it even involves funny hats. But once you got it down, Cap'n, I assure you it's more than worth it! Yay for Xenophilia!"
  STR_BEASTMEN_TAMING_UFOPEDIA: "We did some reading of them Old Books, and so there was this guy called Enkidu, and he was like, a Beastman, only a cool one. And he was turned into a fine man by one priestess, using the art of love and magic of reading. I guess some medical procedure was also applied to make him look better."
  STR_ANIMAL_TAMING_UFOPEDIA: "Animals and monsters can be hunted and butchered, but learning how to make them do as we say is a higher achievement. Animals can help us in combat, and the skills we've developed can help ourselves survive in the wasteland as well."
  STR_DOGE_NAMED_UFOPEDIA: "Dogs can too become true members of our Crew. They will not only get a name, but also their own bunk in the barracks (we don't keep crewmembers in animal pens!) and better care ($300/month). These Pirate Dogs will be able to increase their skills, but only through battle experience. Being more obedient, they will also occupy normal Crew seats in our craft, so we could deploy them in larger numbers to rend our enemies asunder."
  STR_BLOODOGE_NAMED_UFOPEDIA: "We can now elevate our favorite Blood Hounds to the rank of full-fledged members of the crew. These beasts will receive extra care and training in the Beast Den, which will allow them to increase their skills, just like normal soldiers do. With their new position, their support cost will rise to $1000/month. They will also receive their own bunk in our barracks - no real crewmember can live in animal pens!"
  STR_SKINNING_UFOPEDIA: "Through the study of monster species, we have developed techniques to recover their hides and other valuable body parts.{NEWLINE}Butchery of corpses and livestock is available at Workshop, under Extraction category, marked with a B letter. Numbers in parentheses correspond to: hides, meat, misc items."
  STR_KEVLAR_WEAVING_UFOPEDIA: "The Old Earth Books contain knowledge of a material, called Kevlar, used by ancient humans to craft their personal armor. While it hardly protected against anything else than bullets and shrapnel (which can explain the human defeat), it was lightweight and flexible. It can be quite easily reproduced using our lab equipment."
  STR_ROBOT_DISASSEMBLY_UFOPEDIA: "We have learned to disassemble captured robots for spare parts & profit. Check the Disassembly section in the Workshop menu. You can only disassemble robots you have researched first. You will always get that robot's chassis, like from a destroyed one, plus weapon parts and other junk."
  STR_PIRATEZ_HIERARCHY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Each caste is divided into several tiers. The bottom of the ladder consists of Minions, whose purpose is to conduct day-to-day tasks of the caste, and Security, who are charged with keeping everyone else safe. Above them are specialists of various kinds: Pilots, Engineers, Medics etc. who can be exchanged for a better ransom or interrogated for any secrets they may hold - such secrets will prove crucial to our advancement. Their superiors are the middle-level leaders: the Reps, the Espers and the Reverends, but interrogating these beasts will be useless without sufficient preparation. On the very top of the hierarchy are VIPs; the richest and the most powerful."
  STR_PERSONAL_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "We have conducted some studies on the commercially available types of personal armor. In general, they're based on lightweight, but extremely durable materials - like polymers (called 'Aqua Plastics' for some reason) and quasi-organic fibres to withstand armor-piercing ammunition. They're sometimes reinforced with 'magno-alloys', which are electricity and heat superconductors; this helps to dissipate energies unleashed by laser weapons which have otherwise little trouble digging through armor. With this technical knowledge, we might start to dream about developing (i.e. jury-rigging) our own kinds of armor - and weapons to combat it."
  STR_HEAVY_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "We have mastered one of the secrets of the Traders - large-scale plastasteel construction methods. Now we can actually design and manufacture our own ships, instead of just cobbling old fighter hulls together. We can also build Armored Vaults now."
  STR_HABITATION_ADVANCE_UFOPEDIA: "The usefulness of comfy all-enviro habitation cannot be overstated, both in space exploration and on this ravaged planet alike."
  STR_RETICULAN_GENETICS_UFOPEDIA: "Reticulans speak of a 'gene code zero' which is sacred to them, since it represents the perfect Sectoid. This code however can only be copied using rare ancient equipment, so it is a slow method to make new dudes. The Rets are desperately trying to find out how to mate with other species to breed Ret babies, but so far were only successful in breeding hybrids. They also are looking for ways to become stronger and better-suited to Earth by improving upon their sacred code zero, which probably means it's not so sacred after all. The super-quick regeneration we have witnessed on Sirens and Sectogres seems to be the most amazing effect of all this."
  STR_RETICULAN_POWER_SYSTEMS_UFOPEDIA: "Reticulans use bizarre tech - it's not that the parts are anything unusual, but they are welded in ways that an Earthling just wouldn't think of. It's mostly made from collected material of various origin, which makes their systems look even uglier. They're working nonetheless, and pretty efficient, which makes them worth taking for our own use. The fact they're scavenged is actually good for us, since it makes their study and copying easier."
  STR_RETICULAN_HIVE_UFOPEDIA: "While Reticulans do have individuality, their whole society seems to be following some sort of a hivemind mentality. No Reticulan, Siren or Sectogre will betray the hive willingly, and arguments or fights between them are virtually nonexistent. They also freely share property between themselves and have little inhibitions. We think this can be explained as a side effect of the VooDoo abilities of the Reticulans. Hybrids and slaves are much less affected by this hive effect."
  STR_ADVANCED_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "As far as we know, chemical-propelled projectiles - aka firearms and missiles - were known on Earth for centuries and are still widely used; the Star Gods see little threat in those. But there are better weapons too. The least powerful of those are Laser weapons, supposedly developed on Earth around the time it was conquered. Laser weapons ignore 1/3rd of armor. More powerful and less common are Gauss weapons, of uncertain origin. They were designed for a race stronger than humans. These have code locks and cannot be used straight away. The third group, Plasma weapons, genuine weaponry of the Star Gods, requires even more arcane understanding..."
  STR_COMBAT_101_UFOPEDIA: "There be lots of stats and whatnots about weapons and armor. Smart reads here first.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}*GUNS generally cause 0-200% of their base damage on any hit. Bonus POWER is added before any rolls. So if your attacks do not work, it's not always because the weapon sucks.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}*EXPLOSIVES generally cause 50-150% of their base damage and are applied against BOTTOM armor if the explosion happens within 3 tiles of the target.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}*RESISTANCES stated in the ARMOR entry modify the rolled damage by their %.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}*FINAL damage is reduced by the ARMOR value and applied to HEALTH if higher than armor, hopefully leading to DEATH."
  STR_COMBAT_STRESS_UFOPEDIA: "Them gals can't help but be nervous in battle, since they'd rather live to see the treasure. A battle that goes on fer too long increases the risk of enemy reinforcements arriving or sumthin' else going awry (or she just gets bored). Therefore, them gals constantly lose Morale, until it stabilizes at around half their Bravery score. Keep their enthusiasm high by Killing enemies."
  STR_EVASION_UFOPEDIA: "Evasion is an ability to dodge melee attacks (including guns used in melee range). Most enemies will have some Evasion score. This score directly decreases the accuracy of melee attacks by its flat value. Lightly armed fighters will have Evasion based on Reactions, while heavily armored ones - on Melee. Some especially heavy armors and tanks have a flat Evasion score, representing the difficulty of landing blows on these. To attempt Evasion against firearms, you need 6 Energy, although it will be spent only if successful."
  STR_DRESSUP_UFOPEDIA: "Prepare early, else you might end up having to fight nekkid!{NEWLINE}>You can change your outfit only in the Hideout. There are several ways: 'Hands', 'Armors', or by pressing 'A' in a Hand's Inventory.{NEWLINE}>Simple rags are available in unlimited quantity; all other outfits must be manufactured, looted or bought. Outfits worn by landlubbers are usually unfit for Ubers: wrong size, lack of style, unhealthy spirits. Newly hired Hands bring their own clothes.{NEWLINE}>Some items, like Adventurer or Pirate, are whole wardrobes rather than single outfits. If a Gal wants to change, but we have no spares, she needs to strip first."
  STR_FINANCES_UFOPEDIA: "Our lil' enterprise might turn out to be profitable, but seven hells, doesn't it cost a lot of Dolaros to run. Buildings and crafts need to be maintained and powered, crew needs to be paid (especially these damned Brainers), all is paid at the start of any month. On the other hand, we're receiving Protection money from various countries. If we have enough Infamy at the end of the month, they will pay more, but if we make fools of ourselves, the payments can be reduced. Check your financial status either in Logs or Charts. Some things to be wary of:{NEWLINE}>Liabilities/Moneymakers: checks these categories to see which items cost you monthly fee, and which earn monthly profit.{NEWLINE}>Loot: loot can be sold, used or researched. If things go bad, there's always something to sell (including buildings){NEWLINE}>Manufacturing: some items are profitable to manufacture - this can be a good source of income.{NEWLINE}>Infamy Bonus: Each month we receive extra $333 per every Infamy point above 0. The bonus is one-time.{NEWLINE}>Loan Sharks. These keep to the shadows but it's surprisingly easy to find one, especially if you're in bad financial shape. We can run into a negative balance, but if we do it twice in the row, we're goners. Better keep liquidity."
  STR_PILOTING_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Our crafts need at least a single pilot to fly, sometimes more. In case of multiple pilots, their skills are averaged. Relevant skills are Firing (accuracy bonus), Reactions (dodge bonus) and Bravery (approach speed). Bonuses/penalties received by worn armor do not count."
  STR_GOTTA_GO_FAST_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The quicker the victory, the more glamorous it is. If we manage to finish a raid within 10 turns, we might garner some extra Glamour; we don't know what it really is, but each gives +10 Infamy. Finishing in 2.5 turns means maximum possible extra Glamour, but, on the other hand, using nukes to accomplish that might have the opposite effect. Also, not all battles are glamorous..."
  STR_INFO_UFOPEDIA_DETAILS_UFOPEDIA: "Bootypedia entries on items and outfits contain a button labelled ANAL, which, as you have surely guessed, is a short for 'Analysis'. Opening it up will display precise (and unprocessed) technical data. I'd advise against reading into these too much; real knowledge can be only gained on the battlefield." 
  STR_SURRENDER_UFOPEDIA: "Sensible enemies can surrender, if the resolve of all active units is broken. Units which have panicked or were stunned at least once count as broken. Insensible enemies are often good to eat."
  STR_BOXES_UFOPEDIA: "Always be wary of the 'What to wear' tab in briefings which indicates restrictions on wearables. If wrong gear is equipped, the gals will be forced to change into whatever is available, which can be suboptimal. In the worst case scenario, they will end up in boxes. The Box abstractly represents a situation when the gal in question was completely unable to participate in the mission. In such a case, all you can do is to either win without their help, or carry the Box to the extraction zone."
  STR_WALK_THE_PLANK_UFOPEDIA: "The crew is fiercely loyal when things are good, but when times get bleak, you might face open mutiny and replacement. How then to avoid being dispossessed, humiliated and discarded?{NEWLINE}>Keep Infamy higher than {NEWLINE}-500. You can make a slip once, but if you don't improve Infamy the next month, it will be a very clear sign for the crew that finding a new Cap'n is the only way to survive.{NEWLINE}>Don't go into too much debt. Again, you will have a month to reduce your debt to below $1M, else the crew will nominate you as a part of the collateral."
  STR_TRAININGS_UFOPEDIA: "The secret we've just obtained opens before us a completely new set of options, which allow us to train our Gals, augment them, or even change them completely. Trainings are to be found under the 'Soldier Info' tab in the 'HANDS' menu. Once a training is selected, all eligible soldiers at that Hideout will be displayed, along with precise information of what will be achieved and what will it cost. Availability and results may vary a lot depending on individual. Note that sometimes to make a Training available, we will need to possess an appropriate building at that Hideout."
  STR_LOOT_DISTRIBUTION_UFOPEDIA: "We had fun, now let's talk about money, to know what we're standing on and what to offer our potential comrades. The Escaped Lunatics, being part-owners, agreed to take no money unless they gain the rank of Boss Gal. New recruits won't usually be so generous.{NEWLINE}Did I mention ranks? Yes, the more gals we have, the more and higher ranking officers we'll need. Officers will get a monthly cash bonus: Boss Gal $20k, Mistress $50k, Princess $100k, and Queen $250k. One Boss per 4 Gals, one Mistress per 3 Bosses, one Princess per 2 Mistresses. One Queen per 69 total crew and never more than one. So say we, the crew."
  STR_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "We can look for potential crew members amongst our fellow Ubers who visit Jack's Town, or use our Brainers' contacts to import them.{NEWLINE}>Runts: Those gals who are either unwilling or unable to carry a gun, can be hired to operate our Workshops. They take $5,000 monthly pay.{NEWLINE}>Brainers: Weird gals who can be hired to staff our Lab. However, these beasts demand $100k monthly pay, so they can easily drive us into bankrupcy.{NEWLINE}>Hands: Those who will fight. Not only it is easier to find a willing warrior than a skilled one, but with our narrow demographics, that's not even the main problem. Which is, how to find randomly wandering Uber gals anytime we might need them, and in any number?"
  STR_DIVERGING_PATHS_UFOPEDIA: "Cap'n, we're faced with a question. Should we keep our all-female crew purity, and only admit males on special rules? Or should we take advantage of the fact that trained male soldiers are easily available for hire? The former would require us to invest substantial research into finding a steady supply of Uber gals (Uber boys won't likely want to work for us anyway). This will only affect hiring on the open market, not any alternative sources we can find.{NEWLINE}This situation presents us with two choices. Diverging topics of research are displayed next to each other and indicated with '?' signs. Researching one topic will remove the other - permanently. We will surely face more of such dilemmas in the future."
  STR_GALS_ARE_SUPERIOR_UFOPEDIA: "We should not trust the fallible inferior races, nor throw away our purity and unity. We shall remain a primarly female crew. Them Brainers have expanded our recruitment networks to every Black Market hub, but we gotta bear the upfront cost of $50k for each Hand and wait 5 days for each. Unlike our founding Escaped Lunatics, they must be paid at the end of each month: Swabbies $2500, Gals $7500. The starting quality of these troops will vary a lot, but with training, they will get invincible!{NEWLINE}This decision, however, did create some misgivings amongst both the crew and the outsiders (-250 score)."
  STR_WE_NEED_MALE_TOUCH_UFOPEDIA: "We shouldn't be too superstitious, we won't have a successful operation without employing males! Assorted riff-raff and would-be mercenaries are more than willing to join our ranks in bulk. Even if we discount those who cannot bear our Hellerium indoors, that's still an inexhaustible supply of manpower. We will need to pay $15k upfront for each (including tax and insurance). We will call these recruits 'Slave Soldiers' (SS)."
  STR_WE_NEED_CRAFT_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "So much stuff flying overhead, and nothing to do, as our craft have no guns! Well, our first craft doesn't even have weapon mountings, but these are details! One problem at a time, and the lack of airpower is a major one! From what we have gathered while window-shopping in Jackstown, the so-called Highwaymen have access to those. But to raid them, we need to get some general knowledge about who is who, and also interrogate those who are in the know - Highwaymen themselves, but also some more important people, like movers and pushers of 'Ratling Mafia'. Once we know enough, we can unlock a mission (indicated by '!!' marks)."
  STR_HOTKEYS_UFOPEDIA: "Oi, Cap'n... So you wanted some protips?{NEWLINE}MMB: examine item/topic{NEWLINE}F5/F9: save/load ship/personal equip template{NEWLINE}DEL/X: clear Craft/Hand Inv.{NEWLINE}Alt+Ctrl+X: Clear unequipped{NEWLINE}X: mark all as read{NEWLINE}A: change armor{NEWLINE}M: change avatar{NEWLINE}I: Switch Craft/Base Inv.{NEWLINE}Q: Quicksearch{NEWLINE}C,P: Global Research, Works{NEWLINE}T: Targets of Interest{NEWLINE}R: Radar Ranges{NEWLINE}END: Jukebox{NEWLINE}CTRL-Click on Ignore: Ignore this vessel now and later."

  STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_UFOPEDIA: "To get more riches, captives and knowledge, we need to act more proactively, instead of relying on our own radars and random gossip.{NEWLINE}Research topics marked as !Mission! will unlock a new mission, which will start appearing no sooner than the next month. Researches marked as *Mission* will do the same, but also change or disable existing events.{NEWLINE}'Trophies' section includes more info on Bounty Hunting."
  STR_UNDERGROUND_MISSIONS_UFOPEDIA: "If you see 'Depth' instead of 'Weather', the mission requires descending underground. The main problem is that the gals will have to leave any 2x2 armors behind, and continue in whatever they were wearing inside. Sometimes tunnels are so tight that only units smaller than gals or even humans can make it there."
  STR_SPACE_MISSIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Space, as they say, is the final frontier. Our first step: space stations in orbit, lulled by the false sense of security, waiting to be boarded!{NEWLINE}>Orbital entry points will spawn at Earth's poles; there's the least magnetic interference with our Cloaking Devices.{NEWLINE}>Not all ships can climb into orbit; all interceptors and gunships have enough power, as well as craft specifically marked.{NEWLINE}>Only weapons and armor marked as '0-G' will be available for space boarding; 'Exosuit' is not enough. You cannot Run in 0-g."
  STR_ENGINEER_PLUS_UFOPEDIA: "Interrogating an Engineer brought a host of info which can be used to develop advanced navigation, communication and industrial technologies... once we know where to apply this knowledge.{NEWLINE}As a side note, it seems that the Engineers are none the wiser about how Star God technology actually works; they seem to only possess knowledge on how to maintain, assemble and replace parts."
  STR_PILOT_PLUS_UFOPEDIA: "We gave one of our crafts a good spin, for science of course. I believe this unique experience will come in handy when designing advanced vessels, but I plan to repeat it a few times just to be extra sure."
  STR_ACADEMY_MED_KNOWHOW_UFOPEDIA: "We have learned that part of the locking mechanisms on Minilaunchers is a genetic code - if we can defeat the electronic part too, we'll be able to use them. We can also start studying our own physiology as long as we have a reference material from the Raiders, who are of the same species."
  STR_ACADEMY_ENG_KNOWHOW_UFOPEDIA: "We have obtained a host of Academy technical secrets, pertaining to such things as laser weaponry and mind-machine interfacing."
  STR_TRADERS_ENG_KNOWHOW_UFOPEDIA: "Most of the Traders' technological expertise revolves around large-scale construction, powered armor and nuclear power; we have obtained knowledge that will let us advance in these areas."
  STR_MERCS_ENG_KNOWHOW_UFOPEDIA: "The Mercenaries have a unique understanding of the workings of their Synthsuits, advanced personal combat-aid systems, and also seem to know more than most about Gauss weaponry."
  STR_ACADEMY_ARC_KNOWHOW_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We have learned the Academy's secrets of VooDoo."
  STR_TRADERS_ARC_KNOWHOW_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We've gotten info about an ancient technology cache, supposedly hidden somewhere in the Eurasian Autonomy. We need to learn more about that area of the world before trying to seize it, though."
  STR_CHURCH_ARC_KNOWHOW_UFOPEDIA: "We have learned many things about the inner workings of the energy fields used by the Church of Sirius."
  STR_ACADEMY_COM_KNOWHOW_UFOPEDIA: "The Provost was thoroughly researched and revealed all her secrets, including how to break the VooDoo curse on Stellar Empire weapons."
  STR_TRADERS_COM_KNOWHOW_UFOPEDIA: "The intricate armored suits of Trader honchos hold no secrets from us anymore. We have a crucial bit of information required to build an ultimate suit of armor, as soon as we have mastered all the branches of armor-smithing."
  STR_SCIENTISTS_UFOPEDIA: "Our three Brainer weirdos used to associate with many nerds like them over the ethyr-waves. If we shell out $200k plus half as much montly pay, it will surely make them eager to jump out of their current bondage and flock to our Hideout. Looks like we got some sort of a cult status, or maybe it's about our Lab. These vat-raised crazies are way too out-of-this-world to be spies, so this is probably safe. Alas, they never had any real job before, just counting them weird number sheets, so besides their buff brains, they only know myth and legend, and will have yet to learn how to make sumthin' practical for us."
  STR_ENGINEERS_UFOPEDIA: "The people who crew our workshops. They're all sorts of Ubers, half-Ubers or other mutants who like the Hellerium radiation and dolaros, but aren't really interested in fighting. With a monthly salary of $5k, there is no shortage of such people, even if they need to travel from far away. Runts are all female, since the gals agreed that bringing men aboard might bring us bad luck."
  STR_MUTANT_ABILITIES_UFOPEDIA: ">Awesomeness{NEWLINE}We be smooth as Purebloods while tougher, faster and more deadly.{NEWLINE}>Quick Learnin'{NEWLINE}One reason why we only accept gals, even if they're often pretty weak initially. The girls of our Uber mutant strain can learn and improve very fast.{NEWLINE}>Night Vision (NV){NEWLINE}We can see in the dark better than most others, including Purebloods - 12 tiles as opposed to 9 (unless the bastiches employ night goggles). To take an advantage of that, it is imperative to keep to the shadows."
  STR_MUTANT_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "It seems all the variations of mutants we see (most famous being Lamias, Bugeyes and Brutes), ultimately come from the same source - the so-called 'Pureblood' humans who used to be the single race inhabiting the Earth. Nowadays, they universally cooperate with the Star Gods to retain their 'purity', amongst other things. But back to the point, since most of the mutant variants can be broken down into several discernible, stable and reproducing 'abhuman' strains, there is only one possible explanation - the Star Gods experimented on humans to custom-tailor slave races for their own ends. What remains on Earth are possibly their failed experiments, or ongoing experiments under observation, or some sort of reserves - the Star Gods have such abundance of resources. Whatever the truth is, the wealth of medical data we have gained could be immensely useful to us (check Factions)."
  STR_MUTANT_PHYSIOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "After comparative analysis of Academy data, examinations of our soldiers and captured Raiders, we understand much more about ourselves. Like Raiders, we are members of the 'Uber' strain, stronger, faster and tougher than humans, with much denser muscle and skin. We owe all that to our metabolism which is able to process Hellerium. This also makes us radiate an aura of energy, which is responsible for our innate magical abilities."
  STR_MUTANT_SHIELDS_UFOPEDIA: "We have finally unlocked the secret behind that uncanny resilience of ours, and some of the other mutants. It seems that our bodies are producing a defensive VooDoo shield, that keeps us from harm. These innate abilities can, undoubtedly, be further honed and enhanced."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_LEGACY_UFOPEDIA: "There's no denying it. The Uber strain bears too much genetic resemblance to Chryssalids for it to be a mere coincidence. It is inevitable to concede that Ubers are a crossbreed of Chryssalid and Human: human traits becoming turbocharged by Chryssalid's hellerium-powered metabolism. Since Chryssalids themselves are genetically related to Zombie Parasites they carry (most likely through genetic engineering), that makes Ubers related to Zombies as well."
  STR_BRAINER_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Our original Brainers are three Uber gals who were raised by machines in the bowels of a small space station. Such stations are built by the Academy to turn the best child prodigies they capture into super-smart, mutated 'infotech' specialists, to be later sold to the highest bidder. However, when the girls spotted a weird ship drifting nearby, they decided to break out and escape. It was a barely-flying wreck though, and it crashed near our base, leaving behind the mysterious Menacing Hull, as we call it. Such coincidence seemed very suspicious until they told us about dreaming about the same purple-eyed woman as we did... Now they're all TOO happy to run our Lab, if we put up with their exorbitant expenses and eccentricity - like their disdain for wearing any clothes, since they didn't need any on their station."
  STR_SPACE_SURVIVAL_UFOPEDIA: "Staying in space for prolonged periods poses a special challenge for us Ubers, as we rely on Hellerium circulation within an ecosystem. As we cannot simply eat it, designing custom environments was imperative before going on extended void forays."
  STR_MEDICINE_UFOPEDIA: "It's no myth, it's the reality: when you go into a combat zone, injuries happen. The most dangerous are those which result in immediate death. Next in order are the aptly named Fatal Wounds. A wounded soldier loses as many HP's per turn as Fatal Wounds she has, until patched up or dead. Loss of health reduces all Combat Skills, reduces Energy Recovery and inflicts constant Stun damage. Fatal Wounds to arms and head drastically reduce Accuracy until healed, same with torso wounds reducing Energy Recovery and leg wounds - TUs.{NEWLINE}We'd like to experiment some more, Cap'n, but the hands are reluctant to participate, would you help us catch some volunteers?"
  STR_ADVANCED_MEDICINE_UFOPEDIA: "We have attained a level of biotechnology known only to the Star Gods' most trusted servants. Things like cloning, eternal youth or advanced mind-magery are within our grasp."
  STR_ADVANCED_CLONING_UFOPEDIA: "We can now clone all sorts of exotic biomatter, if needed, using Hellerium powered microbes as catalyst (both Cloning Centre and Extractor must be present)."
  STR_PHARMACOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "Ahh, pills, elixirs, concoctions! The real friends of any Brainer, Cap'n! But while this is fun, the practical value of this discovery is even greater. We have opened up the way to advanced healing techniques, as well as combat drugs. Also, we can now manufacture Medical Supplies and sell them to the destitute population for a very good profit. Save the world, get rich!"
  STR_COMBAT_DRUGS_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "Just shake and stir. Well, in reality it is more complex than that, and we need a Refinery built first, but then we can produce as much Combat Drugs as we please. Really."
  STR_TRANQUILIZERS_UFOPEDIA: "Our medical studies have given us knowledge of pure academical value... Actually, no. Using darts coated with new, super-potent tranquilizers makes taking hostages easier than ever before."
  STR_STEALTHSUITS_UFOPEDIA: "Seems that the partial invisibility of the Stealthsuits is achieved by somehow bending visible light and electromagnetic radiation. This technology is very exotic and seems to operate on principles alien to Human or Star God science as we know it. It bears resemblance to the VooDoo invisibility effects but seems to be completely unrelated to VooDoo."
  STR_GRAV_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA: "After getting our hands on an anti-gravity unit, it wasn't all too hard to figure out how to make it work again. We can take combat to the skies now, unfettered by pesky gravity. Just be careful: anti-gravitic circuitry reacts violently when exposed to Chem."
  STR_INSPECT_MACHINERY_UFOPEDIA: "Ay Cap, I speak for the Runts. What, something's wrong with my outfit? I'm not one of them Brainer sluts, it is just practical in this heat, got it? Anyway, we took a gander or two at the hardware around this ol' base. We've got that Extractor to extract nukage for profit, and the Still to distill stuff. The ol' Armored Vaults! Man! Dat sexy cannon, these thick bulkheads! But for now, we'll only be able to build us some basic Vaults. To expand our options, we'll need to contact some merchants about tools and resources. A word here, simple facilities can be built over to save time and money. So, if you want some hard, proper work done, just contact us. And, Cap, for all that is holy, don't lose that Menacing Hull, I'm getting a lady boner just looking at it. Do I talk too much? Here, you look like you need a smoke. (Buddha-X added)"
  STR_SCI_REP_UFOPEDIA: "Hello Cap'n, your favorite Brainer here. Let's break down what we need for what, it's too hot in here for lengthy talks.{NEWLINE}>SCORING. To keep scoring, keep us funded and interested. Missions can be a bugger but research, especially interrogations, are a good source of Infamy.{NEWLINE}>WORKSHOP. To manufacture good stuff, we need one. To have it, we need to get special tools and understand them. Hunt for them, Contact Merchants & Builders for supplies, and help us design Durathread outfits for these idiots Runts so we can force some fun dress code on 'em.{NEWLINE}>SCIENCE. The Lab is cramped. I-we need to have some... privacy in our research. I have something in mind, but we'll need to clean this place up and take a look at that SC Wire first. Ta-ta, till next time, Cap'n..."
  STR_SCHOOL_BOOKS_UFOPEDIA: "We have gathered enough books and manuals to get this whole sci business going on a wholly different level, possibly giving you laser guns or even immortality. What do all those mysterious words mean though? To beat knowledge off someone, that sounds logical, not 'into someone'... Looks like we need to do much reading. Build us a Library, will you?"
  STR_SCHOOLING_2_UFOPEDIA: "Reading books and solving equations surely has a lot of bad press in this world, and these tasks surely make one's head hurt, but the haters won't be laughing anymore when the fruits of these hard labours will become evident. Reason and thinking for oneself instead of listening to people is the only path to power.{NEWLINE}Our next step: we need to gather knowledge about superconductive circuits, chemistry and medicine, then launch the 'School Graduation' project. We also need a Library present at our Hideout to launch it, and it is likely to take long to complete."
  STR_SCHOOLING_2_B_UFOPEDIA: "Long and arduous work bore forbidden fruit. By bringing our knowledge to this level, we have the understanding of sophisticated technologies. Still, yet higher power is possible - but it's unclear what's it going to take."
  STR_SCHOOLING_3_UFOPEDIA: "From the dirtiest pits of hell to the ivory towers of truth, we're here. Even the highest technologies can be understood now, but it's not the end station yet. More work is needed still, yet the goal of ultimate power beckons ever closer."
  STR_PIRATEZ_COOKING_UFOPEDIA: "Roasting iguanas-on-a stick or frying fresh Carnosaurus eggs is sure fun, but nitrating glycerol with white fuming nitric acid, for example, beats that hands down!"
  STR_BALLISTICS_UFOPEDIA: "Cannonballs! How cool are they? No need to answer, Cap'n! We have figured out how to construct more of 'em, using only domestically available resources, no less! We also know how to build cannons that can hit the wide side of a barn. All this knowledge will surely become even more useful once we have a proper Workshop running, so no need to cut my salary!"
  STR_FLINTLOCKS_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Aye, them brainers figured out how to restock our armory with some explodey stuff, if there's ever such a need, Cap'n. They be makin' this explodey stuff out of Uber Flour, of all things. They better continue to be of use, coz' with so much coin they cost us, the temptation to throw 'em overboard be strong."
  STR_SMITHING_UFOPEDIA: "Hammerin' 'eavy metal into submission be not easy, even with how tough we are. We don't even that much need it for forgin' weapons themselves, as for moddin' various bitz found in scrap metal to suit our crafting needs."
  STR_PRIMITIVE_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Them firearms are all nice and dandy, and they're sure makin'a lot of noise, alas they need bullets. More simple weapons do not need such fancy things, and yet they're often more potent, if used right."
  STR_PRIMITIVE_WEAPONS_2_UFOPEDIA: "With better tools, come better blades. Without these tools, further advancement would be nigh-impossible."
  STR_ALCHEMY_UFOPEDIA: "Alchemy is about mixing and distilling various essences. Especially distilling is of interest; we can build more Stills now."
  STR_POISONED_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "If you were thinking using poisons to dispatch people was dishonorable, you wouldn't be reading this, Cap'n. And indeed, we do have concocted a few nasty surprises for our enemies..."
  STR_INDUSTRIAL_TOOLS_UFOPEDIA: "With our continued tinkering, invention and scavengery, we have secured a broad array of tools that'll allow us to construct even more complex machinery than before."
  STR_EXCAVATION_UFOPEDIA: "From primitive weapons, we have progressed to less primitive tools and work organization, Cap'n. Mining has several secrets, like you cannot put back broken rock together with duct tape alone, or that a runt cannot carry 99 large rocks in each pocket so a logistic chain is needed. We'll be able to custom-design new facilities, invent new practical jokes involving runts, and who knows, maybe this will inspire us to some stuff that cannot yet be guessed!"
  STR_GEMOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "Our knowledge of arcane circuits says that various precious stones are used in them to achieve different vibration, flow and effect. We can now start thinking where this piece of the puzzle fits - we don't know yet what effects can be conjured besides the obvious ones. However I'd advise to store any found gems, since their unique qualities are definitely needed to achieve just the right vibration to summon great powers."
  STR_ZORTRIUM_MANIPULATION_UFOPEDIA: "One does not simply make Zortrium to do her bidding, but I happen to be an expert on crystals of all sorts. In the end, it was just a minor hindrance in my quest for Orichalcum! Ah yes, Cap'n... I can shape you some Zortrium stuff, but it is a very intricate and slow process which will eat into my precious study time, so don't bother me without a serious need, won't you? It will also need a Power Plant."
  STR_BASIC_INCENDIARIES_UFOPEDIA: "The destructive power of fire will strike fear into our enemies; take that, cruel world!"
  STR_TINKERING_UFOPEDIA: "Science has never been so much fun! With all the tools and resources available in the Workshop, we Brainers can design various gadgets and gizmos, and also research stuff that was impossible to research previously. Going from all this lofty philosophy to direct applications is refreshing for sure."
  STR_SC_WIRE_USE_UFOPEDIA: "This technology is widely used in all advanced power storage and distribution. Learning its secrets is crucial to progressing further in our understanding of the topic."
  STR_DURATHREAD_WORKING_UFOPEDIA: "Durathread is a quality material for nigh-indestructible and comfortable clothing and other things, making it sought-after on the Black Market. The only accessible and plentiful source is robbery of Guild personnel and other lucky guys who wear it. Things made from Durathread are not only often armored, but they also offer environmental resistances. This technology is also a crucial step towards setting up our own Workshop. Who could ask for more?"
  STR_DURATHREAD_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "With the secret of manufacturing Durathread from Plastasteel for cheaps, we can make a fortune on it. We only need a Industrial Printer on the site of manufacturing."
  STR_PLASTASTEEL_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "We have mastered one of the crucial trade secrets of the Stellar Empire - the manufacturing of Plastasteel. Turns out, there's no magic to it - all we need are Industrial Printer and Powerplant, and some basic components. The process itself is extemely profitable, considering current Trader's Guild prices, and has the potential to seriously loosen the economical grip the Empire has on Earth. We can let this genie loose by researching the 'Rebel Trading' project that will replace one of recurring monthly enemy activities with friendly traffic that will generate us a steady increase in Notoriety."
  STR_SYNTHMUSCLE_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "We can now print Synthmuscle from Durathread, if we ever run dry."
  STR_PRECISION_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "The immediate benefit of this is that we can cheaply print various complex Imperial equipment. However, this requires automation, which is represented by 50 Workshop Space required."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "We have advanced to a point where we can produce customized powered armor parts from raw materials. This will not only allow us to stop relying on salvage, but we will also be able to design completely new kinds of powered suits. The fabrication process is fast, but requires a lot of automation, thus taking up 100 Workshop Space. It also requires a Printer."
  STR_IMPROVED_HELLERIUM_DISTILLING_UFOPEDIA: "The process of distilling Hellerium from the sludge has always been useful, but rather slow. However, with the help of the Refinery and Power Plant, we can quintuple the speed of pumping Hellerium out. This highly automated process will, however, take up 75 Workspace."
  STR_AIR_FILTRATION_UFOPEDIA: "To survive foul chemical vapours and not suffocate in the smoke and fumes, so endemic to the hostile environments outside, we have developed our own versions of protective gear."
  STR_CHEMISTRY_UFOPEDIA: "After a lot of experimenting with blowing stuff up and burning it down, and even spraying it with acid to see what happens, we have gained more understanding of the underlying laws governing such stuff. Now we can start researching more complex chemical substances, both for destruction and creation. I swear, we're really getting smarter here. Was this supposed to be so?"
  STR_CHEMICAL_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Power to the chemical industry! Airborne sprays and poisonous gases can kill or disable enemies without all the mess associated with explosives. Anyone who needs to breathe is susceptible. Such convenience!"
  STR_MAGNETOHARMONICS_UFOPEDIA: "A hull of a Hellerium-powered ship is its own propeller. This is achieved by carefully composed currents, running through its superconductive walls, creating a complex and harmonious electromagnetic field matrix. Mastery of this art allows us to conceive more agile craft, as well as to improve our understanding of magnetic weapons and fields. Know the proper vibration and nothing is impossible."
  STR_MAGNETIC_CONTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}It turns out that during the waning days of Old Earth, after the conquest, the humans grasped ways to tame even the most savage forces of nature, employing powerful and multilayered magnetic fields. These secrets are now ours as well."
  STR_MELEE_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Melee weapons are characterized by high and dependable damage, however using them effectively requires skill. Pay attention to weapon stats, as those useless for a weakling might be deadly in the hands of a strong warrior. (In inventory, press ALT with the cursor over a weapon to check its damage for the current Gal; or Ctrl+M in battle). Many enemies will Evade blows, making them land less frequently than the displayed accuracy suggests. Muscles, planning and bold action are the keys to success; overconfidence and lack of tactical acumen will lead to many a funeral."
  STR_SPECIAL_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "The following section covers all unusual hardware that doesn't fit into other categories, from chainsaws through thrown weapons to muskets, and much more."
  STR_BOWS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "Bows shoot with an arcing trajectory, which makes them very useful in dense terrain (but not in the forest, where the tree canopies are a major issue).{NEWLINE}The Throwing skill commands both accuracy and a large part of bow damage, so don't expect good results from anyone with Throwing below 50; however, experienced soldiers can inflict fairly heavy damage using bows. High Stamina is also essential for an archer, since the larger bows put a major drain on it.{NEWLINE}Bows don't get any accuracy bonus from kneeling, and shooting them costs a fixed amount of TUs, so make use of your mobility.{NEWLINE}Arrows often inflict less damage to enemy Health than expected, so don't rely on them in 1 vs 1 situations."
  STR_PISTOLS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}The main advantage of pistols is that they suffer no accuracy penalty when your other hand is occupied. They're also fairly accurate, shoot very fast and fit the quickdraw (QD) slot. Pistols also suffer the least when being fired in melee combat (over 100% CQ Accuracy). The main disadvantages are: limited accurate range, lowish damage and reduced accuracy bonus from kneeling (just +10%).{NEWLINE}We now understand how cased ammunition works and we'll be able to reproduce it, once we have a proper Workshop."
  STR_SHOTGUNS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Shotguns have the highest close-range accuracy of all guns, although their accurate range is severely limited. They usually fire pellet munitions which have huge damage potential, but are completely useless against armored targets.{NEWLINE}Shotguns don't require high abilities to use (the base skill is 50 + Firing/2).{NEWLINE}Shotguns are best used in close quarters combat, where they almost guarantee a one-shot-kill against ordinary enemies; their CQ accuracy is similar to rifles' 90%. Watch out for their notoriously slow reload."
  STR_SMGS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Two-handed SMGs and, partially, Carbines fall under this category. These weapons have higher volume of fire than Rifles, as well as faster aiming, usually allowing them to fire two aimed shots per turn. They often have reduced single-handed use penalty (per gun description), and can be fired in melee at 90-100% accuracy. Also they're usually capable of Spray fire. Thus they're particularly good at delivering high amounts of pain at medium ranges."
  STR_RIFLES_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "Rifles are the most average weapons of all, and most dependable, even if they don't shine in any single aspect. All rifles have two general advantages:{NEWLINE}> Unlimited Aimed Shot range;{NEWLINE}> 15% Armor Penetration with Piercing munitions (Firearms only). This does include machineguns and sniper rifles (but not chainguns), as long as they don't get any bonus damage based on soldier's stats (Rifles that get such a bonus are excluded as well)."
  STR_SNIPER_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The most common characteristics among these weapons are slow firing rates and a serious influence of shooter's skill on the damage inflicted. This means potential damage far exceeding that of normal rifles. 'True' sniper rifles are governed by Firing^2 * 0.01 skill, making them almost useless for warriors of Firing below circa 75. Rifles governed by this formula also inflict more dependable damage (a sum of two 0-100% rolls instead of a single 0-200%)."
  STR_HEAVY_WEAPONS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "Heavy weapons are not simply heavy, but they often require forethought to use properly. When planning to use one, be sure to check if you're strong enough, if the weapon doesn't get a major accuracy bonus when used from a kneeling position, if it requires offhand to be free (a red '2' in Inventory) and how punishing are TU costs of its attacks. Also it is generally unadvised to fire them in melee.{NEWLINE}A study of how these are built seems crucial to making our own heavy weapons."
  STR_EXPLOSIVES_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "Explosives never fail to provide fun. If exploded directly on someone, they attack the under armor, which is usually the thinnest; they also do quad damage vs. large units. Blast usually weakens by 10 per tile, but eg. Fire inflicts full damage within the whole area.{NEWLINE}>Launched. These use some kind of a launcher and explode on contact.{NEWLINE}>Thrown. Much like the former but require no launcher.{NEWLINE}>Fused. They explode after a set number of half-turns (0 is after your current turn, 1 is after the next enemy turn, 2 is after your next turn etc). Prime, then Throw or drop.{NEWLINE}>Proximity. When primed, they explode when someone enters or leaves a 1-tile radius."
  STR_MAGITECH_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "Magitech is sophisticated equipment, amplifying one's VooDoo powers; the Stellar Empire has known it for so long that this technology can be found in endless applications. This knowledge is essential for our development of said equipment.{NEWLINE}Contrary to popular opinion, the mage is rarely the main source of power; her relevant mental skills (V.Power and V.Skill, but sometimes also Bravery and others) rather, allow using an instrument's power to lesser or greater extent, and everyone has a V.Power rating, even if it's hidden (not evaluated)."    
  STR_AMMO_ARCANE_UFOPEDIA: "Academy Provost's knowledge allowed us to devise munitions brimming with arcane powers. They ignore 3/4th of enemy's armor, rarely underperform, and inflict triple stun damage. They have a devastating morale effect, too. Their power is augmented by user's VooDoo Power (*0.13 per each 7 base damage). Be careful, though, if your intention is capture instead of horrible death - Arcane Rounds do inflict Fatal Wounds and their victims need to be healed to survive. Arcane Rounds require Hypno Panels to manufacture."  
  STR_AMMO_MANUFACTURING_1_UFOPEDIA: "This is the workshop reportin', Cap'n! Don't mind all these explosives lying around, will ya? We're just starting to figure out what to do with'em ourselves. Anyways, using these to produce pistol bullets seems easy enough, and we'll be able to replenish our supplies without paying those sharks at the marketplace! Just keep us supplied with Chemicals and Scrap Metal. Workshop out!"
  STR_AMMO_MANUFACTURING_2_UFOPEDIA: "We're getting a knack! Figuring out how to produce standard bullets for rifles took us some time, but we've finally nailed it. However, replicating AP rounds here is too much hassle to be worth it. Just first, these bitches from the Lab need to tell us the specifics of a weapon the ammo is for!"
  STR_AMMO_MANUFACTURING_3_UFOPEDIA: "Firearms are said to be underpowered, compared to more advanced weaponry. This is not necessarily true. We're ready to start designing some extremely powerful models, based on old Earth blueprints. The time for big game hunting is on."
  STR_CANNONS_MANUFACTURING_1_UFOPEDIA: "If a rifle is pretty decent at killing people, then a hand-held cannon is inherently better. The problem was, such weapons tend to blow up in the face if shoddily made. But no more; we can finally start working on new weapons, unrestrained with bothersome things like caliber."
  STR_MUTANT_GUNS_UFOPEDIA: "We were thinkin', Cap'n - that's what you're paying us for, 'fter all. And we thought, since them Gals are much stronger than humans, why should we be using human weapons? Sure, better science gives better firepower, but increasing the size of a simpler gun should increase the raw power in equal amount."
  STR_SHOOTA_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "The basic idea of guns made especially for us caught on, and now we followed up with even bigger calibres and ammo counts. We can now produce all-piratey shooty things like Handcannons and Boarding Guns!"
  STR_ACIDIC_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "Everyone knows that there are three general ways to defeat carapace armor: hi-powered lasers, high explosives and a cutlass wielded by a brave, yet not necessarily smart, warrior. Each way has its own shortcomings. However, we have discovered that the commonly used carapace has a certain weakness: chem. Being earthlings, and thus particularly ingenious at killing stuff, we have designed a few types of chemic ammo to exploit that weakness."
  STR_EXPLOSIVE_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "With the capabilities to home-manufacture explosive shells, we can start to blow things up with reckless abandon. Not like we have to. But it has been a hard and pebbly road up to this point, so why not celebrate some. Everyone likes fireworks, right?"
  STR_STUN_BOMB_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "We have finally mastered - well, sort of - the secret of the Stellar Empire Stun Bombs. Turns out they use the same strange magic as the Hypno Panels and share some of the construction with the Mind Probe. Taken together, we can readily manufacture more of these wondrous VIP-catching bombs, as long as we can secure a supply of Hypno Panels."
  STR_LASER_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "Now we can construct ammo clips fitting all commonly-used laser weapons, using superconductive loops as energy capacitors. These won't be as powerful or capacious as Nuclear-based clips, but still pretty close - and much cheaper. However, to charge these clips, we need higher energy density than available in our grid, so we need to build a dedicated power station."
  STR_LASER_AMMO_NUCLEAR_UFOPEDIA: "With this technology we know how to replicate nuclear-based laser weapon clips, just like those commonly found on the battlefield. However, the knowledge alone is not enough, and we need an Industrial Printer facility operating at a Hideout to be able to do so."
  STR_LASER_AMMO_AP_UFOPEDIA: "Having gained deep understanding of particle/wave physics, down to Neutrino and Subspace level, we have devised a way to further empower laser weaponry - and as easily as by fitting them with new power cells. Advanced coolants will make sure the weapons won't explode. These new cells will, on average, raise the armor piercing quality of lasers by one-third. Raw power will increase by half, but capacity will be cut in half. We won't be able to retrieve Hellerium used to produce them."
  STR_LASER_DISASSEMBLY_UFOPEDIA: "To start constructing our own laser weapons, it was necessary to learn how they're built. Now we can disassemble these lasers into components, which can be more efficiently stored, and out of which new laser weapons can be built.{NEWLINE}Lasers can be broken down into 4 main components: Energy Weapon Parts, Laser Lenses, Focusing Crystals and Heavy Power Couplings. Here's the breakdown of how many parts various types and sizes contain:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Small: 1/1/0/0          Sub: 2/2/0/0{NEWLINE}Standard: 2/1/1/0         Large: 3/1/2/1{NEWLINE}Large Auto: 3/3/1/1       X-Large: 4/2/2/2{NEWLINE}X-Large Auto: 5/4/3/2    Small Craft: 10/4/4/2{NEWLINE}Large Craft: 20/8/8/4"
  STR_GAUSS_DISASSEMBLY_UFOPEDIA: "As with the Laser weapons before, we've learned how to disassemble Gauss weapons now.{NEWLINE}They can be broken down into 4 main components: Energy Weapon Parts, Gauss Coils, Energy Capacitors and Heavy Power Couplings. Here's the breakdown of how many parts various types and sizes contain:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Small: 1/1/0/0          Sub: 1/2/0/0{NEWLINE}Standard: 2/1/1/0         Large: 3/2/2/0{NEWLINE}Large Auto: 3/3/1/1       X-Large: 4/2/4/1{NEWLINE}X-Large Auto: 5/4/3/1    Small Craft: 10/4/4/2{NEWLINE}Large Craft: 20/8/8/4"
  STR_PLASMA_DISASSEMBLY_UFOPEDIA: "Per analogiam with less advanced weapons, we have figured out how to disassemble Plasma Weapons - which doesn't mean we know how to use them or how they work.{NEWLINE}Plasma weapons can be broken down into 5 main components: Energy Weapon Parts, Plasma Chambers, Inertial Accelerators, Heavy Power Couplings and what we call Magischen-Motors. Here's the breakdown of how many parts various types and sizes contain:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Small: 1/1/0/0/1         Sub: 2/2/0/0/1{NEWLINE}Standard: 2/1/1/0/1         Large: 3/1/2/1/1{NEWLINE}X-Large: 4/2/2/2/1       Small Craft: 10/4/4/2/2{NEWLINE}Large Craft: 20/8/8/4/2"
  STR_LASER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "As is often the case, putting laser guns together turned out to be a little more challenging than taking them apart. Most of them are too complex to even bother, and we need to know more to construct standardized clips for them. The simpler ones we can make, though."
  STR_PARTICLE_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "It seems that the Plasma Weapons used by the Stellar Empire are just an advanced application of a technology known also by the name of Fusion Guns. Even these are too advanced for us, but we still can employ their basic physical principles to be able to blast enemies with Plasma, especially since we don't mind Hellerium radiation that is sure as hell to leak out. We expect good accuracy and hefty, dependable damage, but power loss over distance is unavoidable without Magnetic Containment mastery.{NEWLINE}We'll need a Printer to manufacture these."
  STR_GAUSS_CANNON_AMMO_PROD_UFOPEDIA: "Gauss cannons sure are potent, but we've lacked a way to reproduce their ammo, thus being reduced to scavenging. Not any more - through luck, trial and error, we've reproduced the required Plastasteel forging process."
  STR_RAIL_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Advances in our understanding of various aspects of technology led us to designing our own brand of Gauss weapons, which we call X-Gauss. We have sacrificed some of the raw power in exchange for major miniaturization and better ergonomics. This will allow our warriors to capitalize on their personal skills while using these weapons."
  STR_PLASMA_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "Stellar Empire's plasma weapons use very carefully callibrated, highly compact Hellerium magazines, which we finally worked out how to replicate. We'll need Printers and Powerplants."
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "The knowledge of exotic dimensions and phase mechanics has opened our eyes on what to make of the Plasma Scorcher. Now we'll be able to conjure highly explosive plasma balls on the battlefield, with likely awesome results. Stellar Empire handheld weapons are not that... stellar in comparison, so to speak."
  STR_NUCLEAR_LASERS_UFOPEDIA: "After some more R&R, uh, I mean, R&D, we're ready to start designing custom nuclear laser designs. Good-bye ammo dependency, hello unrestrained firepower.{NEWLINE}Regarding disassembly of Nuclear Lasers, you will get the same amounts of parts as from normal lasers. You will also retrieve all Plastasteel used in the production."
  STR_NUCLEAR_GAUSS_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "We have learned the secrets of manufacturing the Stellar Empire's Gauss ammunition. The technology entails using an Industrial Printer to create a lattice of Plastasteel, laced with Hellerium clusters for efficient energy storage and release."
  STR_SLAYER_BULLETS_UFOPEDIA: "It makes little sense for us to reproduce standard pistol munitions, which can be bought off the free market. Therefore we came up with an idea for a special ammo type! These bullets are pistol-only, as they'd disintegrate or jam the gun when fired from a fully automatic or high velocity weapon. Compared to standard ammo:{NEWLINE}> +50% damage to HP;{NEWLINE}> +50% Shock;{NEWLINE}> Extra Pain (5) - damages Morale;{NEWLINE}> Enemy armor effectivity +x%, where x is bullet's Power (worst for high-powered ammo)."
  STR_AQUA_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "Aqua Plastics can be worked into sharp, lightweight darts, multiples of which can be fitted into bullets. They will have lower power than normal projectiles, but will ignore as much as 50% of armor, and deal Cutting instead of Piercing damage. Only selected weapons are able to take such ammo; mostly, as it happens, SMGs."
  STR_PLASTASTEEL_MUNITIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Using plastasteel in conventional munitions manufacturing is expensive, but yields some improvements. By replacing the bullet jacket we can achieve higher damage, without losing FMJ's ammo 15% armor piercing qualities. The clips can be made thinner, increasing the capacity by approximately one-fifth. However, this technology is practical only for high-velocity weapons, like rifles or machine guns."
  STR_EP_MUNITIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Using Superconductive Wire to hold a potent energy charge inside a bullet's tip, it is possible to manufacture so-called Pulse munitions. While expensive, such bullets cause horrible electrical burns and cause quad stun damage (ignoring Shock Immunity)."
  STR_MAG_MUNITIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Instead of expending effort in trying to develop full-fledged rail weapons, we drew inspiration from the Rail Driver and prepared self-propelling magnetic munitions that can be fired from sufficiently robust firearms. As the ammo needs a power source and magnetic coils, the ammo is heavier, but the firepower increases by 25-50%. The Armor Penetration, if any, is lost, however."
  STR_NUCLEAR_MUNITIONS_UFOPEDIA: "You requested more firepower, Cap'n, and we are happy to deliver results. Using minuscule amounts of Hellerium as propellant and Plastasteel for a harder-hitting warhead, we were able to devise more powerful ammunition for selected firearms that can survive the stress of such a discharge. We could warn you that these new munitions are a bit volatile, but the hands are unlikely to listen anyway, so why bother."
  STR_ELERIUM_EXPLOSIVES_UFOPEDIA: "Using Hellerium to produce explosives is a very hard trick, but to a degree, we can do that now. In a dirty way. Most of the Hellerium involved is going to turn to fallout, with efficiency close to 10-20 %, as we rely on conventional explosives laced with it. However, if all you need is a good bang, there is no reason to complain."
  STR_FUSION_EXPLOSIVES_UFOPEDIA: "Through studying various weapon designs and containment fields, we believe we have reached the level of understanding of Hellerium's chemistry required to unleash its full destructive force in a safe manner. More or less. To the point, we have designs for new rockets and grenades you're going to like. What you're not going to like is the fact that we need a Fusion Furnace to manufacture them."
  STR_ATOM_POWER_UFOPEDIA: "Indeed, we now have some understanding of how nuclear fission - that is, splitting of atoms - works. Still we have no idea why the Star Gods are so iffed at this technology. Maybe it's because it doesn't use their Hellerium, but something much less... nice. For now, we have figured out how to make this and that, but the topic is challenging. We need a Power Plant and a Refinery present at a Hideout to effect any atom-related manufacturing."
  STR_ELECTRICS_UFOPEDIA: "We have studied the underlying principles of Force Circuitry. We have blown up a whole lot of them, but we devised how they can be used to generate all sorts of powerful discharges, like unstable forcefields that'd improve our melee weaponry. There seems to be much more to the Force Circuitry than meets the eye, that is, than refractors and holograms. Researching power- and material-related technology, as well as interrogating enemy leaders seem to be the keys to progressing further."
  STR_POWER_SOURCE_TWEAKING_UFOPEDIA: "Turns out that, unsurprisingly, careful tweaking of a ship's engine to a specific airframe allows us to achieve greater performance than simply putting random engines onto it. All that and more is possible once we understood that invisible, but tangible forces that motivate such vehicles are streams of certain tiny particles of matter/energy."
  STR_SELF_REPAIRING_HULL_UFOPEDIA: "Ship hulls and other components are made of separate cells, which can regenerate when provided energy and raw material. Molecules are transported via carbon nanotubes and plastasteel crystal grows to repair damage or wear. Now we can design ships with a properly working regeneration system."
  STR_FIGHTER_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Developing our own fighter beyond the clunky H/K seemed like an impossibility, until we got schematics of a working, commercial ship and found out that, in fact, the body plan of Imperial ships is stupidly easy, the only problem being hi-tech components that must be salvaged (and studied), as they're impossible to reproduce."
  STR_MINI_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "High-performance engines burn Hellerium to dust, but it is also known that the isotope can be used as power storage by carefully depleting most of the power contained in it. The energy density is much lower, but such an arrangement can be recharged. The process is very tricky but can be used to create things like powered armor."
  STR_COMMUNICATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "The underground information web the Brainers are so fond of, the Ethyrnet, is separate from official, Traders' Guild-controlled Holonet, although it is not impossible to infiltrate one from the other. Ethyrnet, used basically by every community, relies on innumerable private comms sender-receivers, transmissions heavily scrambled to hide in the jungle of EM background noise. Ethyrnet is how Jack can contact us and all his tribes, it's how Black Market and Mutant Alliance communicate."
  STR_OPTRONICS_UFOPEDIA: "All the computation in Empire technology is based on so-called Optronics, or optical processing, as well as mind-boggling algorithms devised by the Star Gods. It is somewhat analogous, though, to Old Earth's Electronics that we learned about. While internal workings of these devices are extremely complex and trying to understand them is a forlorn effort, all we really needed to coerce them to do our bidding was to gather enough practical knowledge of their language and a body of suitable, stolen programs to do calculations for us, while getting rid of parts and software that takes years of training to be used."
  STR_CODE_BREAKING_UFOPEDIA: "Many of the advanced weapons and other stuff we're finding is protected by annoying personal locks, based on various genetic encryption algorithms the Academy Medic was so kind to inform us about. Now we can breed savage viruses to spectacularly tear through these encryptions, allowing us to pirate these artifacts!"
  STR_DATA_ENCRYPTION_UFOPEDIA: "When it comes to computer code, the Star Gods are truly worthy of their title. Their encryption software is unbreakable, and their compression algorithms approach average 99% size reduction on large amounts of data, making interstellar communications much easier and allowing them to keep entire personas stored digitally on relatively small Optronic crystal matrices. The math involved is truly beyond human understanding, but we have procured a selection of maintenance tools and backdoors to penetrate their locks, and exclusive software that could allow us to run powerful data centres of our own."
  STR_PBA_TRAINING_UFOPEDIA: "The gals aren't used to interacting with machinery that invades their privacy too much, like heavy armored suits or cybernetics. Unlike guns, such things are considered evil magics. However, to advance further, learning to live close to machines is unavoidable. We have prepared a special course to hopefully defeat superstition in that area."
  STR_THERMAL_EXCHANGE_MESH_UFOPEDIA: "Working in hostile environments requires an attire that isolates you from them - and this creates an ample opportunity to be cooked alive. Air cooling is obviously off, while liquid cooling is very bulky. The way out of this conundrum is utilizing thermal-superconductive fibers. How cool, indeed, it feels on your skin!"
  STR_EXOSUITS_UFOPEDIA: "An 'Exosuit' is a suit that allows survival in exotic environments - like other planets with no breathable air. This is not to be confused with '0-g' armors that allow space boarding actions and absolutely need some means of propulsion.{NEWLINE}Any armor that is described as 'is Exosuit' is viable in these extreme enviros. Developing an Exosuit is a serious challenge - starting with Hands' understandable fear of man-machine fusion, and ending with a plethora of systems that allow comfortable survival in such a small, sealed vessel."
  STR_CYBERNETIC_INTERFACE_UFOPEDIA: "With a command interface which pre-processes all input and uses sophisticated holo displays, an operator can react much faster and with more precision than when she's handling some buttons and levers. This leads to more hacking fun, as well as better flying armors and fighters."
  STR_MIND_MACHINE_INTERFACE_UFOPEDIA: "The pinnacle of command interface is a machine that becomes one with the operator - she hears, sees and feels everything the machine does, and can command it with a mere thought. Not only does it allow improved performance, but is also elegant and space-saving."
  STR_SMART_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "We have pursued an exciting path of experimentation - tweaking salvaged Slave AIs to command autonomous weapons systems! No, this doesn't mean we can immediately start to manufacture killer robots, at least until a suitable chassis appears. A less ambitious, but more promising approach is putting Slave AIs into handheld weapons, getting a real-life auto-aim!"
  STR_HYPERWAVES_UFOPEDIA: "Hyperwaves is what these smart engineer types are calling the invisible and intangible medium of instantaneous communications. We can use this knowledge to develop a facility dedicated to decoding vessel transmissions and transponders, which means not only instant detection, but also info on who's flying the shipping, its type and mission. However, this means tons of cryptographic work, so the results aren't likely to appear soon."
  STR_SHIELDS_GOLD_UFOPEDIA: "The shining Refractors have the advantage of being the easiest to use; as they create a blob of what can be described as liquid crystal, which follows the wearer, clinging to her electromagnetic field.{NEWLINE}Slow-going Daze, Chem and Bio have little chance of hurting the wearer, dealing only 25% damage.{NEWLINE}Lasers, Stabs and Electrics inflict 50% damage.{NEWLINE}The liquid has trouble with Plasma, Cutting, EMP, Warp and Mind, which deal full damage.{NEWLINE}Fire wreaks havoc across the whole structure, causing 250% damage. Piercing and Concussive attacks strike brutally enough to ignore Refractors altogether."
  STR_SHIELDS_BLUE_UFOPEDIA: "These arcanist shields form a barrier of what can be called 'hard light', which assumes geometric shapes and follows the movements of the wearer thanks to intricate programming.{NEWLINE}They are unparalleled at stopping brute force attacks: 25% damage from Piercing, Burn and Concussive.{NEWLINE}They are almost equally good at countering exotic energies: 50% damage from EMP, Mind and Warp.{NEWLINE}They protect normally from strong energy attacks, like Laser, Plasma and Electricity. They only have trouble with slow-moving, low-powered threats: Cut and Stab deal normal damage, while Daze, Chem and Bio go through unimpeded."
  STR_SHIELDS_PURPLE_UFOPEDIA: "Disruptor Shields do not create a barrier, but rather an aura that gets the most dense inside the protected item or person, making them much harder to deform permanently.{NEWLINE}Warp, EMP and Mind are rendered thus almost completely harmless, causing just 25% damage.{NEWLINE}Daze, Chem and Bio still work, but at a reduced effectivity, causing 50% damage to the shield.{NEWLINE}Direct forms of attack like Piercing, Fire, Concussive, Cutting and Plasma inflict full damage.{NEWLINE}Only Laser, Electricity and Stabs are so focused that they cannot be impeded by these shields at all."
  STR_SHIELDS_RED_UFOPEDIA: "Energy Shield is much like a skin-tight armor of circulating energy, which, like an army, directly confronts any foreign energy trying to break through.{NEWLINE}The most focused attacks cause the harshest reprisal; Laser, Electricity and Stab cause only 25% damage.{NEWLINE}Piercing, Fire and Concussive are next in succession, dealing 50% damage.{NEWLINE}As the attacks grow 'softer' so reaction is less coherent and the energy loss is greater.  Cutting, Plasma, Chem, Bio and Daze dish out full damage.{NEWLINE}EMP is the bane of these shields, draining their energy fast with 250% damage multiplier. Mind and Warp attacks are too sneaky to be noticed and they go right through."
  STR_SHIELDS_ENERGY_CIRCUITS_UFOPEDIA: "Red Shields use up lots of energy. To really control their workings, we needed to learn how to direct all that energy in a controlled manner, without blowing up the fuses and burning the user too badly. It turned out that orderly superconducive lattices with the right gems used as resistors will do the trick."
  STR_SHIELDS_DYNAMIC_COMPUTING_UFOPEDIA: "Blue Shields do not require massive energy feed, but lots of computational power. Their effectiveness largely hinges on intricate calculations, required to set the barrier to just right resonance frequencies in precise points of time and space. Understanding how to achieve that feat and gain control over this technology, not even really understood by the Academy, was impossible without us grasping at least some general principles of the Divine Code."
  STR_SHIELDS_1_UFOPEDIA: "We have made preliminary observations regarding the nature of this exciting technology. Energy shields take damage before it reaches armor, and their resistances to various forms of it may vary a lot, but they have no armor value themselves. The following damage types ignore energy shields: Charm, Choke, Anti-E511, Heat & Cold. In SHIELDS descriptions, the first number is max capacity, while the other - regen at the start of every our AND enemy turns."
  STR_SHIELDS_2_UFOPEDIA: "Having analyzed intricate shielding, worn by that enemy VIP, we have figured an innovative, yet so obviously simple, way of deploying shields: as handheld... shields. The ability to mix, match and stack them as needed cannot be underestimated. However, they have a major disadvantage: Burnout. It happens after a set time after activation. If you don't manage to finish the mission before that, a shield will be lost."
  STR_FORCEFIELDS_UFOPEDIA: "With the information procured from a Reverend, we were finally able to break the mystery of the craft-mounted energy fields. They're able to project or dissipate all sorts of energies, making them useful in both attack and defense. As it turns out, they're just a partial implementation of ship-mounted shields of the Stellar Empire. Such real shields regenerate fast (usually .25% per second), but require bulky machinery. However I think we can devise some simpler, hybrid shields for our own ships, lacking that sort of regeneration, but small enough for their frames. To regenerate them, our ship would have to spend 1 hour undergoing maintenance."
  STR_STARGOD_SHIELDS_UFOPEDIA: "Quite unsurprisingly, the Star Gods know a lot about making shields, and the shields they're using on their own ships are quite on a different level than the cheap knockoffs the Church is tinkering with. Not only are Star God shields more efficient, they have devised a number of support technologies to further enhance their potency. Most of the physics involved is far too arcane to understand, much less learned from an interrogation, but I think we have gained the understanding of at least one useful bit; with enough technological base of our own, we'll be able to devise shield recharging systems small enough to fit our miniature craft."
  STR_SUBSPACE_UFOPEDIA: "To actually travel through a 'Black Hole', instead of being destroyed by it, Star God vessels enter a sort of a parallel dimension, called 'Subspace'. It is said to somehow exist outside of normal spacetime, and thus allows far greater speeds than normal warping. On the downside, you cannot enter it without a pair of 'Jump Gates', each utilizing a 'Black Hole'. Also, it is never certain when the gate can be opened and how long will the travel take."
  STR_GRAVITY_PHYSICS_UFOPEDIA: "The Stellar Empire has mastered the use of antigravity, as can be witnessed in the easiness of use of the Grav Harness and antigrav vehicles. The body of knowledge we have secured will let us optimize our own antigravitic technologies."
  STR_LIQUID_METALS_UFOPEDIA: "It is well known that Plastasteel can be shaped by magnetic fields, but a less known fact is that certain liquids can share similar qualities. This technology has many applications - from dynamically-conductive coolants, to polymorphic liquids that can rapidly assume any shape in reaction to magnetic field, to even things like liquid armor that can dissipate thermal and kinetic energy, leeaving no openings or weak spots, and opening up when needed. This technology doesn't seem to be fully grasped by our sources, but none the less we learned a lot."
  STR_TRACTORS_AND_REPULSORS_UFOPEDIA: "An important technological secret of the Stellar Empire, Tractor and Repulsor Beams are used to either pull or push mass without any physical contact, often at large ranges and stupendous scales. The mechanism somehow involves Hyperwave and Gravitic Physics. In a more mundane form, we know it from commonly available Lifters. We're quite sure that with enough base knowledge, we'll be able to replicate this technology for our own, nefarious needs."
  STR_PHASE_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "Perhaps the most exotic and arcane of Star God technologies, it is based on the strange 'phase-shift' effect, where something can exist in our reality, but yet, not quite so. When applied to individuals, a phase shield can make them invisible and intangible to most weapons, while perfectly able to shoot back. It still cannot fool motion scanners or psionic detection, though. When applied to a craft, the results are less spectacular, effectively amounting to a major boost of shield strength."
  STR_ETHEREAL_TRAVEL_UFOPEDIA: "While the Warp Drive is the way through which the Star Gods run their Empire, they deeply abhor the chaotic nature of that technology. They prefer travelling alone or in small groups, at sublight speeds, inside a bubble of psychic energy that separates them from the ravages of the void. Such travels take hundreds thousands of years, but the immortal Star Gods do not mind. They take nothing with them, but huge amounts of compressed information. They create everything they need after arriving."
  STR_NEURAL_SCANNER_UFOPEDIA: "A closely guarded secret of the Star Gods, this sophisticated device is able to read, write and erase the contents of one's mind. The Stellar Empire uses it for intelligence purposes, as well as to imprint skills, knowledge and loyalty upon their freshly-bred clone soldiers.{NEWLINE}However, the Scanner has its limitations. Every mind, especially a natural-grown one, has its unique internal language of great complexity, making any deeper tampering difficult, imperfect and damaging.{NEWLINE}The much less potent, portable version of the Scanner is known as the Mind Probe."
  STR_SENSOSPHERE_UFOPEDIA: "A device used mainly by the Star Gods' clients. The recipient is levitated inside a sphere, which can both read and stimulate their nerves, while being fully opaque from inside, and sound-proof, thus creating an inescapable virtual reality if needed. If desired, the observers can feel the experience directly through arcane linkage. The device has a wide range of uses, from punishment and interrogation to training to pleasuring oneself."
  STR_RETEGES_UFOPEDIA: "The Star Gods have long ago unlocked the secret of eternal life. The necromantic technology they use is called 'Reteges'. Nobody outside of their own race is allowed to use it, and nobody knows how exactly it works, yet the general mechanism is known. The principle is to move the consciousness, or soul, from a dying body to a fresh one, through a matrix that sustains it."
  STR_DISRUPTOR_MYSTICISM_UFOPEDIA: "This exotic branch of Dimensional Physics seems to be far surpassing even the Star Gods. Our sources claim it came to Earth from a mysterious place called 'Dimension X', where a race of hyper-advanced aliens dwells. Not much is known either about these beings nor how this technology really works, except for two things; firstly, it is the principle of operation of portals and Disruptor (Purple) Shields; secondly, some aspects of it can be recreated using mystical powers, if one can achieve proper attunement. This is how Reticulans manage to employ it, and, as rumor says, it's also why Star Gods nor their followers will never be able to."
  STR_GAUSS_UNLOCK_UFOPEDIA: "We finally found the tools to break, or rather circumvent, the codes blocking Gauss Weapons. We can now freely use them."
  STR_PSI_UNLOCK_UFOPEDIA: "It turned out that the Stellar Empire's weapons - like Plasma guns - operate on pure magic. I mean, not exactly operate, but to use or otherwise tamper with them, one needs to bond with the weapon on a magical level. Actual sorcery is not needed, anyone can be trained... even if in some cases, it's a long and sad process. To the point - now we can operate said weapons, or take them apart to learn their secrets."
  STR_KULTUR_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}We choose to be Pirates, and confront reality with our ideals. So what makes a Pirate here and now?{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>VIOLENCE. Hard to argue with the 'if it doesn't work for you, you are not using it enough' principle.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>CUNNING. Because working harder is less profitable than working smarter, especially when it's others who do the work for us.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>SURVIVAL. Because look at us - we be, like, top of the food pyramid!{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>WEIRDNESS. Who are we? Why are we here? Then you start asking questions like 'How can I live better?', and finally you get to 'How can I rule the world?'.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}These are the four cornerstones of our Pirate Culture. All are important, but pursuing each will take some time, so tell us what you want us to do next!"
  STR_SS_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Allowing Slave Soldiers to join our ranks immediately flooded us with new ideas on how to organize things. They have shared their knowledge about firearms, hunting with dogs and various mechanical stuff (we can expand on the latter two with extra prerequisites). Their connections also allow us to get stuff from Merchants that's normally unavailable.{NEWLINE}However, the Gals are quite unsure what to think of it:{NEWLINE}-200 Infamy.{NEWLINE}(Prepper Box obtained)"
  STR_BONDING_CEREMONY_UFOPEDIA: "It is said that in the days of old, warriors would make love before going out to battle. We did not know men when in our captivity, and there is so much to learn from them, aside from finding strength in their assuring embraces. This loving celebration of oneness in diversity has put the whole crew in a festive mood, and opened our eyes to new possibilities.{NEWLINE}(+200 Infamy)"
  STR_SHAKEUP_CEREMONY_UFOPEDIA: "A newly recruited, young gal be not only unskilled, but also uncommitted to the Cause and our Pirate ways. We have figured out that a shock treatment might be the best answer! And by shock treatment, I mean dipping her in the Hellerium sludge down the Extractor shaft to harden both her body and spirit! Such ordeal involves drinking so much Moonshine that it causes some memory loss. It will also likely put her out of commission for a week or three. Since the deed needs to be done eagerly and in a scary manner, anything she was wearing will be destroyed."
  STR_GLADIATOR_TRAINING_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}If we have a proper Beast Den at a Hideout, we can use it to train gladiators! Any warrior sent there will learn a lot, but the tutelage is painful. Very, very painful. Also some basics are needed first (STR 30, STA 60, BRV 30)."
  STR_PIRATE_LIFE_UFOPEDIA: "We gals here do not know anything about the world and its ways, but since we got into this weird protection scheme with the Govts, we must set some worthy goals to avoid stabbing ourselves and each other too much! Them Brainers inspired us with an Idea - let's become like Pirates of old! Have adventures in style, laugh at unjust property laws, and get as rich as possible! But, at the same time, live with honor and don't fear death, fight to create a safe haven for our people, thus winning everyone's respect!"
  STR_PARTY_UFOPEDIA: "Aye, 'twas some fun we had, celebrating our newfound identity... Honestly I don't remember much of it, but if it was any more wild, I guess the word 'orgy' would be more fitting... Anyway, I heard our excesses already became famous in the area, which will likely help us with impressing certain groups...{NEWLINE}(250 points awarded.)"
  STR_JACKSTOWN_UFOPEDIA: "Ruled by the flamboyant leader of the Lokk'Naar's, 'Captain' Jack, this is the place where we can do most of our Black Market business. The prices are outrageous, but the town has powerful and numerous militia, plus, we won't find better prices in any Black Market trading town, so there's no choice but to play along.{NEWLINE}[More buyables & info unlocked]"
  STR_CONTACT_BLACK_MARKET_UFOPEDIA: "A few miles away from our Hideout, there yonder lives the Lokk'Naar Tribe. This group of short, long-eared mutants controls a nearby trading post, where all flotsam and jetsam from neighboring lands drifts to, greeted by a welcome sign 'the past is dead, the present is overrated'. Since such places daily witness all sorts of weird deals and illicit services, it's perfect for us to get supplies, sell loot, have some fun and find people for any job, from facility builders to fighting crew. There are innumerable places like this, places of gatherings, situated on various crossroads the powers that be are unable or unwilling to control. All these hand-to-mouth mutant communities form a loose network all around the globe, called the Black Market - a vast, unruly, and uncontrollable entity, full of chancers, misfits and outcasts just like us."
  STR_CONTACT_MUTANT_ALLIANCE_UFOPEDIA: "We have been approached by representatives of the so-called Mutant Alliance: a loose organisation with global reach which claims to represent the rights of all mutants (especially the poor and forsaken). With all their talk about political pressure and moderate resistance, these self-proclaimed mutant representatives seem a bit fishy (likely to sell out their allies if they cease to be useful, if you ask me), but they have a share of power in every Provincial Govt on the planet, and came to us bearing gifts, some useful, some less so: influencing the govts in our favor (+1500 Infamy), free textbooks and access to their underground network of supplies.{NEWLINE}As for the price, they expect us to help fighting off the Mutant Pogroms. We will be informed of more Pogroms, and if we don't provide at least a token presence, it will cost us 1000 Infamy each time."
  STR_CONTACT_DEALERS_UFOPEDIA: "Buying stuff that is accessible only for upstanding human citizens isn't easy for those who tread the path of glory, but we managed to win essential contacts, allowing us to get that stuff through various middlemen."
  STR_CONTACT_KRAZY_HANNA_UFOPEDIA: "This mutant lady sells military hardware for longer than anybody can remember and is basically a living Black Market legend. Getting to her wasn't easy and involved some run-ins with her security droids, as she despises 'idiots'; but these misunderstandings disappeared once we started acting nice and showed her our money."
  STR_CONTACT_GUN_EMPORIUM_UFOPEDIA: "Our unabating interest in various gun designs led us to these dealers, who supply a wild selection of rarer models. Some of these guns need to be found and researched, some are available straight away."
  STR_CONTACT_GENERAL_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA: "We have convinced the merchants of Jack's Town that we can be trusted, to some degree. Now they will sell us a wider selection of warez, including these required to develop more advanced facilities. To expand the selection of available weapons, research ones looted from the enemy. Note that only the most common weapons will become buyable through this Contact."
  STR_CONTACT_CAR_THIEVES_UFOPEDIA: "To really get out of this hole and move freely around the whole planet, we need a supply of flying machines. Contacting thieves of mildly restricted, battery-powered craft came easy, as Jack's people operate a tuning shop for such used vehicles. Apart from getting fabulously drunk while dealing with them, we've also learned that to get access to Hellerium-fired craft, we need to get to the so-called Authorized Dealers (just a higher tier of thieves), but that requires better contacts within the financial sector, and the knowledge of Social Hierarchy. We can also try our luck with the Ship Junkyard, who can help us with constructing our own craft. However, we need to learn their comm frequencies and certain tech-savvyness to be able to talk to them."
  STR_CONTACT_BUILDERS_UFOPEDIA: "The denizens of the local Builder's Hall can give us some pointers on to how construct various facilities, including real Workshops.{NEWLINE}External workers can also help us with storage problems; each hired Worker expands our storage space by 4, but takes 5,000 Dolaros in monthly pay. However, they deliver an instantaneous storage capacity boost, without the need to wait for any Vaults to be built.{NEWLINE}The Builders can also help us to coerce some of the landlubbers we catch to do some honest work, if you have such a fancy, Cap'n; the boon will be experience sharing. 'Job Interviews' are titled 'Work:' under Workshop's 'Recruitment' tab. Yes, we'll have to pay them, once their 'trial period' ends."
  STR_CONTACT_SHIP_JUNKYARD_UFOPEDIA: "Getting to people who deal in used ship parts wasn't easy, but we've not only secured a supply of some restricted parts, we also have access to tools which will allow us to construct our own crafts. Note that some crafts burn expensive Hellerium."
  STR_CONTACT_SMUGGLERS_UFOPEDIA: "The Smugglers will provide us with exotic goods from all over the Galaxy, from weapons for our Hands, to high-quality junk our Brainers can tinker with."
  STR_CONTACT_MAGIC_SHOP_UFOPEDIA: "Knowing VooDoo means little if we have no tools to use it. Our investigations in various shady, nocturnal locales netted us an invitation into this obscure establishment, dealing in arcane items."
  STR_CONTACT_MERCENARIES_UFOPEDIA: "After some preliminary talks, the Mercenaries have shown willingness to sign job contracts with us - as long as we have the money, they don't ask questions. A lot of money, since, with who we are, we're unlikely to get prime prices.{NEWLINE}[We can now order kidnappings on the Black Market]"
  STR_CONTACT_FUSO_UFOPEDIA: "Fuso! The land of Ninjas and Samurai! When we made a ruckus at the Black Market, they agreed to supply us with iconic Fuso weapons."
  STR_CONTACT_THEBAN_UFOPEDIA: "Contacting the strange land of Queen-Bee Cleopatra gives us access to Theban fashion, magic and transportation services."
  STR_CONTACT_EUROSYNDICATE_UFOPEDIA: "The arms dealers of the Eurosyndicate have shown interest in our money. They offer us two very potent, if very expensive, laser weapons. They're willing to trade us some even better ones, if we agree to strike a cooperation deal with them - which will likely entail doing some very dirty work. Let's hope we really have what it takes if we don't want to end up as mere scapegoats."
  STR_MISSION_EUROSYNDICATE_DEAL_UFOPEDIA: "HIGHER EUROSYNDICATE CLEARANCE CONFIRMED. YOU HAVE BEEN QUALIFIED TO CONDUCT ELIMINATION MISSIONS FOR OUR COMPANY. BE PREPARED TO ACT ON 24HRS NOTICE. ACCESS TO HIGH-GRADE LASER WEAPONRY GRANTED. HAPPY SHOPPING."
  STR_MISSION_EUROSYNDICATE_DEAL_END_UFOPEDIA: "With the power of our arguments, enhanced by tanks and fighters of MSDF, we were able to persuade the Eurosyndicate to stop pulling us into trouble, while keeping their shop open. Why should serious players treat each other like that. Naturally, they're still a major power, so a compromise needed to be reached (-2000 Infamy)."
  STR_CONTACT_ARENA_UFOPEDIA: "We have gained the trust of a few pushers and movers in the Death Realms, and we can procure some of the actual weapons used in the Death Games! Everyone loves Death Games!"
  STR_CONTACT_DR_WANG_UFOPEDIA: "This Singapore-located shop, run by a self-styled 'Chinese God of Death' has a selection of unique launchers and munitions, likely imported from the underground factories of the Central Province."
  STR_CRAZY_HASSAN_UFOPEDIA: "Regardless of how you received this message, it is an advertisement made by Hassan specially for you. Interested in weapons? If something is a weapon, Hassan has it. Best discounts. No returns: you get what you paid for! Don't hesitate, no gun is too big or too small for Hassan. Repeat customers get free Krazy Kamel figurines hand-made by Hassan's little brother."
  STR_CONTACT_WHITE_DRAGON_UFOPEDIA: "You desire weapons, as does everyone who seeks me out. My trade is to deliver them, to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Into the warzone, where they're the most needed. That is my pride as an Arms Dealer. The price? Not just mere money, of course. Because you're not just a mere customer. You possess unique influence. Why do I need it? I have a plan that will change the world. And you can help it happen, just by trading with me."
  STR_CONTACT_ROGUE_FIELDS_UFOPEDIA: "Contacting the local 'Lords of War' wasn't easy, but now we have access to some of their piratical weapons, including craft armaments and gasoline-guzzling vehicles."
  STR_CONTACT_RETICULANS_UFOPEDIA: "Our... involvement with the Reticulans fruited in their offer to trade. They said, why should we kill each other, if we simply can exchange goods for mutual benefit? They also said the trade should only be the beginning... I can only hope against hope that nothing really uncanny will come out of this, Cap'n..."
  STR_GNOME_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Those wretched Gnomes! They ate my meat, they drank my beer, and now they sleep in my bed. But what are they? Trying to get them to undergo medical examination failed, but I made the measurements while the Gnome was asleep and undressed. Don't let the dimunitive, girl-like body fool you; they're hardy, tough and much, much older than they seem. Gnomes first appeared in early Zones as a weird mutation that produced an immortal, unchanging body; no Gnome ever ages, akin to Star Gods. This allowed them to survive hellerium starvation, despite their dependence on it, but forced them to shrink to a small, more efficient frame. I believe it was a long and extremely painful process."
  STR_SYNTH_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "The Syns were created as living weapons, or a race of warriors, by some unknown entities. They only speak of dark vats where they were born, halls where they trained together, and an overwhelming, motherly, godly presence. Their memories are jumbled, and apparently mixed with memories of many dead people, presumably victims of the Syns' creators. Syns, despite their artificial origins, are living and thinking beings, not some robots; it's just not life as we know it. They are extremely honorable creatures. If we save their lives, they hold us as owners of these lives - and thus, everything they own."
  STR_YOUNG_UBER_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Young, impressionable Ubers we encounter during our voyages can be quite easily convinced to join our cause. To do so, we need to send them to Workshop for our Runts to perform some 'convincing', then wait a day for our new recruit to get ready for the biggest adventure of her life. As a bonus, we will gain some data about our surrounding world. The monthly salary is $2500 for Swabbies, $7500 for Gals."
  STR_FREAK_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Freak Gals are Ubers with unique abilities (or disabilities). We have figured out how to recruit any we might recover during our adventures. As the Freaks are shunned by most people, all it will take is a symbolic Apple to seduce them to our side. As a side note, Freak Gals seem to lose their mind if unable to hug their Smelly Rags every now and then - it must be because of fond childhood memories."
  STR_SOLDIER_M_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Aye, the quality of untrained Hands is often underwhelming. We can now tighten our requirements, but this will also cost us a lot of money: a seasoned Warrior will take $100k initial payment and $10k each month thereafter. What do we get in return?{NEWLINE}>Skills: Better average Firing, Throwing and Melee.{NEWLINE}>Physique: Minimum Stamina, Bravery and Strength at substantially improved levels, allowing to use standardized equipment.{NEWLINE}>Survival Instinct: Slightly better minimum Reactions, Willpower and Health.{NEWLINE}>Armor: Each Warrior brings her own Warrior Armor."
  STR_SOLDIER_V_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Our fame and recruiting skill now allows us to recruit Veterans, Uber warriors of renowned skill and combat record. Each Veteran brings her own suit of Boss Armor. However, they're anything but cheap: each costs $320k to recruit and takes $40k basic monthly salary (before rank bonuses)."
  STR_LOKNAR_EXAMINATION_UFOPEDIA: "Getting the Lokk'Naars to undergo a full 'medical examination' wasn't that hard, but they demolished much equipment in the process.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}TIME UNITS: 45-60; Max. 70{NEWLINE}STAMINA: 80-110; Max. 160{NEWLINE}HEALTH: 20-30; Max. 45{NEWLINE}STRENGTH: 10-20; Max. 30{NEWLINE}BRAVERY: 30-60; Max. 80{NEWLINE}REACTIONS: 70-90; Max. 125{NEWLINE}FIRING: 50-75; Max. 120{NEWLINE}THROWING: 50-70; Max. 90{NEWLINE}MELEE: 50-70; Max. 100{NEWLINE}FRESH: 55-70; Max. 100{NEWLINE}VOODOO POWER: 30-50{NEWLINE}VOODOO SKILL: Max. 70{NEWLINE}V.DEF = V.PWR + 30% V.SKL"
  STR_LOKNAR_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "The Lokk'Naar are plentiful and many of them are willing to join our ranks. They're small and weak but really stealthy. They will take a monthly salary of $7,500.{NEWLINE}All Lokk'Naars have NV of 15 and Thv of 33%."
  STR_HYBRID_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA: "The Mutant Alliance agreed to let us hire their Bugeye soldiers. They might be squishy, annoying and averse to melee combat, but they are very savvy and can use VooDoo powers without any equipment. These powers even allow them to dodge hits from behind with halved penalty. Another asset is their great Reticulan-inherited eyesight (NV 20, ThV 80%). They also have good Reactions. They suffer no Combat Stress. Finally, they require $20k monthly salary."
  STR_SISTER_VICTIM_RECRUITMENT_BRAINER_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Cap'n, with a sufficiently racist approach, we can increase our scientific potential. Castaway Gals are from superior stock, even for Ubers, plus they picked a lot of stuff while in Academy's captivity. A sufficiently radical shock therapy, involving Hellerium vats, will, in my opinion, kickstart their mental capacities enough to count them into the ranks of the Brainers. As for the actual skills, well, they will learn everything on the fly, like our sacred Pirate tradition dictates."
  STR_SPECTRE_SUMMONING_UFOPEDIA: "With the help of the Shadowmasters, we can summon back the spirits of the fallen. But it is a mixed blessing. The body the spirits inhabit is made of energy and is easily dispersed. It also cannot interact with physical world much.{NEWLINE}Only strong spirits can be summoned back. A Gal or a Peasant needs to have a VooDoo Power of 40, Bravery of 60 and Reactions of 60 to be able to return in this fashion. Crossing the river Styx has its price, though: 10% of experience gained on all skills except VPWR and BRA will dissolve into nothingness. No Augmentations carry over, either."
  STR_CHORT_SUMMONING_UFOPEDIA: "We can now perform the profane act of fusing a Gal's soul with a Simulacrum, thus creating a shapeshifting Chort. We need equipment that is only available at Red Tower, as well as 3 Zortrium Crystals; Chorts are demons of Earth element, and they need this highest form of metal available to come to life."
  STR_CLOTHING_BASIC_UFOPEDIA: "Travelling Gals, who are our prime recruitment material, wear sturdy but haphazard clothing. It is quite expensive to buy separately, as flimsy materials do not survive long with our lifestyles. Uber Clothing has no armor value, but provides good pocket space. In a pinch, it can be torn to make bandages. Each set can be worn as one of three patterns:{NEWLINE}>SCOUT. Travel lightly for less encumbrance and more stamina.{NEWLINE}>GANGER. A full outfit that gives some resistance to cold and attacks.{NEWLINE}>ADVENTURER. A fairly light outfit, optimized for archers and melee fighters."
  STR_CLOTHING_UFOPEDIA: "The pirate wardrobe contains a fine selection of clothings, all sharing the same chest. While unarmored, these trappings be filling us with a mighty Pirate spirit, thus greatly strengthening our fighting prowess - each in its own way. No time, nor patience to explain now, Cap'n! We be needing to know 'Our Culture' to understand it all and actually produce these trappings! For now, we've devised 'Sailor Uniforms'!"
  STR_WASTELAND_PRIESTESS_UFOPEDIA: "Our Hideout was visited by a mysterious priestess. The locals described her as a wandering healer who passes the area every couple of years. Although her possessions consisted only of the barest minimum, she seemed strangely unscathed by the elements. Her skill with her hands also turned out to be extraordinary, when she performed healing and purification rituals on you.{NEWLINE}'You have the gift', she said later, once you've laid to rest. 'When the VooDoo power you hold inside will start to wake, seek out the Witch of the Golden Rose. When the time is right, you will find her in the Theban desert. She will help you unlock your full spiritual potential. Well-Wisher's blessings be upon you'."
  STR_MARKET_OF_WISHING_UFOPEDIA: "Welcome, fleshlings. The High Mek Order of the Technocracy has deemed you worthy of our attention. Your progress in controlling information, matter and energy has been classified as relatively impressive. We can provide you with advanced components, as well as mass-produced versions of some of your old inventions. State your requirements."
  STR_EXPEDITION_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "We have already visited the nearby town and villages - it is time to explore the rest of the world! Firsthand, real knowledge about distant countries will help us establish useful contacts. We can gain it from interrogations, but we can also fund Recon Expeditions:{NEWLINE}>They will require 75 Storage space, instead of a Hangar;{NEWLINE}>They will take 40 days to finish;{NEWLINE}>After they arrive, we need to sort the loot at the Workshop (Debrief Expedition).{NEWLINE}Another kind of Expedition is a military one; see EXPEDITION entry in the Vessels section."
  STR_EXPEDITION_REPORTS_UFOPEDIA: "After its 40-day journey, our first Recon Expedition has returned to the Hideout, bringing stories of distant lands and assorted loot it has gathered during the voyage. The strongboxes are a boon in itself, as they can contain all sorts of items, but equally enticing is the possibility of finding new recruits, either willing or unwilling - both kinds will be equally put in our prison for the time being."
  STR_EXPEDITION_RESEARCH_COMPLETE_UFOPEDIA: "We already know the world well enough that the Recon Expeditions became a waste of time and resources. We won't be hiring or debriefing any more of them.{NEWLINE}[+500 Infamy]"
  STR_NO_CIVILIAN_TRAFFIC_UFOPEDIA: "All these Civilian boats flying around were a real nuisance. We have disabled tracking them, and pledged to never attack them again. Well, in a couple of months, there are still a few things to settle... [1000 points and a Memorial Stele awarded]."
  STR_VIP_KIDNAPPING_UFOPEDIA: "Like it was said, Mercs will do any job, no questions asked. If we have the money. [VIPs buyable now]."
  STR_ZERO_ZERO_UFOPEDIA: "Our political sway is growing, and some mysterious powers seem to be helping us from behind the scenes... or maybe too many hours of netrunning made me paranoid, Cap'n. But I believe we can approach the Local Govts more directly, and convince them that betraying us would be like killing a golden goose. To do so, we need full knowledge of political activities around the globe, as well as information about Govt high officials."
  STR_FAMILY_TIES_UFOPEDIA: "Through the help of certain... friends, and by continuing to be useful, we have reinforced our position within the global structure to the point where no sane local government will brandish the 'Zero Tolerance Policy' against us anymore."
  STR_RETICULAN_AND_HUMAN_TECH_UFOPEDIA: "My study leads me to believe there is little direct gain for us here. Any new solutions, would either be sub-par to what we've already scavenged from the Stellar Empire, or impractical to implement without access to manpower and infrastructure on a much grander level that we could possibly ever have. Why would we need fusion-powered equipment if we can buy or scavenge enough Hellerium to cover all our needs? However, the local govts and Reticulans may benefit from this. To help them out, we can start the 'Human-Reticulan Cooperation' project. The downsides are several - first, we need to do this work for free, second, the govts will protect the Reticulans and push some Faction traffic out of business, leading to less loot, third, it might make the govts more dangerous if we cross them... On the other hand, it will weaken the Star Gods and their stooges. Either way, once we complete the project, there will be no going back."
  STR_HUMAN_RETICULAN_ALLIANCE_UFOPEDIA: "For good or for bad, it is done. We have helped the Humans and Reticulans to overcome their differences. Everyone's celebrating, but are we really better off? There is already talk about Govts starting to develop powerful fusion-powered vessels and weapons."
  STR_NO_AGGRESSION_UFOPEDIA: "We have seen them all - from crazed Humanists to thieving Bandits, from organized death squads to Deep One hordes. Normal people everywhere are brutalized on a daily basis, unless they're the privileged who live within city walls. This aggression can't stand, and we're in position to do something about it - permanently. With your tactical genius, Cap'n, and all the military tech we possess, we can help the Mutant Alliance to form self-defense forces. This will allow them to thwart all Pogroms before they even begin. However,  once we complete the project, our tech will be in rebel hands, and we will have no control over it, nor any way of going back."
  STR_MUTANT_SELF_DEFENSE_UFOPEDIA: "It is done. The Mutant Self Defense Forces (MSDF) have been formed, their first deed - blowing up the Solar Courier's HQ and proclaiming they did so in collusion with us. The big factions are upset, to put it mildly. The MSDF (also called 'The Rebels') will fly regular patrols (which will increase our score a bit), which should take care of Mutant Pogroms for good. Watch out for Rebel Fighters (distinguished by yellow and green lights), shooting them down will cost us a lot of nerves later."
  STR_RUSSIAN_FILES_STAGED_UFOPEDIA: "We have a very clear idea now where to look for the mysterious, ancient base we heard about from the Guild Rep we interrogated. Some additional scouting is required to pinpoint its location, but we believe we should be ready early next month."
  STR_RUSSIAN_FILES_UFOPEDIA: "After learning where to look, we've embarked upon an adventure in Russia. In an underground bunker built centuries ago, audio logs revealed a forgotten story. It seems that when the Earth was invaded by the Stellar Empire, most of the planet surrendered after a few years of struggle, but one country - Russia - fought on for a couple of decades (curiously, nowadays the area is a cornerstone of the Mutant Alliance) and became the last refuge of the so-called X-COM project, a clandestine organisation created back then to pit Earth's best and brightest against the invasion. We've found some technical expertise developed by X-COM, chiefly that of nuclear-powered laser weapons that had practically unlimited energy supply. However, to make heads or tails of this data we need to expand our knowledge base in the areas of nuclear weaponry and power sources. We must also examine contemporary Laser and Gauss weapons before attempting to develop laser guns based on X-COM expertise."
  STR_CLOAKING_DEVICE_INVESTIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "There's a great mystery behind one device so crucial to our success - the Cloaking Device. We've found no clue about them in the course of our adventures, they seem to be uniquely available to our Black Market suppliers. Scouring the network yielded little results besides the mentions of such technology being somehow linked to the mythical 'Shadowmasters' - a force which supposedly gifts people on various planets with artifacts of unknown origin, always with some detrimental results to the Star Gods. Having no other recourse, we've forced some Lokk'Naar merchants to talk (-200 score); to our chagrin, they knew very little themselves - the Cloaking Devices are being given to them at secret dropoff points, coordinates being sent to them by unknown benefactors. Elusive and secretive, just like our Well-Wisher..."
  STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "The society of Earth can be broken down into three distinct groups. The first group are the so-called factions: The Academy, The Traders, The Church and The Mercenaries. They cooperate with the Star Gods directly and are given exclusive right to travel freely around the globe. The second group are local, or provincial, governments, the people who pay us the protection money. They're not very happy with their limited power, and the existence of pirates like us is beneficial to them, as it undermines the dominance of the global factions. But if we attack their ships and officers directly, it won't be popular. On the other hand, getting our hands on their stuff has its obvious, immediate benefits. The third group are the poor masses, on whom the Mutant Alliance is based - an influential force within the local governments, a 'civil' face of the opposition towards the rule of the Star Gods, and also our allies of convenience... as long as we're convenient to them. Finally the Star Gods themselves sometimes do make an appearance on our planet. The wise avoid them at any cost. Good thing we aren't wise, Cap'n!"
  STR_THE_MARTIAN_SOLUTION_UFOPEDIA: "The rumors are confirmed now - the Stellar Empire governor of the Solar System resides on Mars, in the Cydonia region. He (she/it) rarely directly influences the happenings on Earth, preferring to let the humans and mutants police themselves... unless something goes out of control. The governor's residence is guarded by multiple layers of orbital defenses, but it seems that the VIPs of each faction possess security passes. However, each faction possesses only a code to a single layer of defense, corresponding to their facilities on Mars. To get to the governor, one would need to get hold of all the passes. It goes without saying that we will also need Exosuits to operate on Mars' surface."
  STR_CYDONIA_OR_BUST_UFOPEDIA: "It is now clear that there is only so much we can do on Earth. No matter how much money, vessels, soldiers or political influence we have, we're always going to be just a pirate gang down here. Sure, it isn't a bad life now, we're rich, feared and respected. But maybe you have your eyes on something bigger, Cap'n? Earth's factions will always have immensely more resources than we do, and they will never let us into their elite club. But if we did the impossible and prepared a direct strike against the Solar Governor, we could - only theoretically - hijack its control network and climb to a different level altogether. If you're bold enough, here's the checklist: first of all, security codes procured from an Academy's Provost, Trader Guildmaster, Church Cardinal and, well Star God Coordinator (some of those might require indepth interrogation). Secondly, a big space ship to take us to Mars, which means top-tier shipbuilding and life support systems expertise. It is a short list, true. But it goes without saying that we have only a single chance to do this. If we attempt and fail, the Governor will immediately destroy us."
  STR_SEA_TRANSPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Between various Trader's Guild monopolies on aerial transport, sea lanes are important for the Black Market to haul its warez between disparate communities. While slow, it is very cheap, but Earth's govts cannot make too much use of it officially as it could invite the Guild's wrath. However, small scale traffic goes on mostly beneath notice from above. The below is a whole different matter altogether, as no one can guess when and where the next Deep One attack will happen. Thus, many ships never return."
  STR_SAT_NETWORK_UFOPEDIA: "It is apparent that the Earth is enveloped in several layers of comm satellites, some of them new, some of them many centuries old. With the knowledge of Slave AIs and Hyperwaves we can communicate with them, but gaining any meaningful info would require more research into the matter. The older satellites seem like a perfect backdoor, but even those require access codes, and while we can probably forge the codes, we can't conjure them from thin air."
  STR_BASIC_ELECTRONICS_UFOPEDIA: "The software, or code, used by commercially available computers is a real jungle that takes a lot of braining to even begin to understand. No doubt there was a lot of malicious intent behind this. We'll need to obtain secret information from world communication networks to make progress there. For now, however, we can simply sidestep this whole mess by working directly on electric parts, slapping them together in various combinations and measuring what voltage goes where."
  STR_DATA_MINING_UFOPEDIA: "The personal databases we find contain scraps of useful knowledge. We can squeeze it out, but that will require a lot of databases and many long, sweaty nights of work."
  STR_GOVT_HACKING_UFOPEDIA: "We have developed a procedure allowing us to access personal data files through the Sat Network. It requires gathering enough human ID cards and manufacturing a Govt Personal Code, then finishing the procedure here by researching it. Excess codes can be sold for a reasonable price. Sadly, only Govt and lower level Pureblood files can be accessed this way - the global factions, nevermind the Star Gods, have too powerful firewalls."
  STR_NAZI_HACKING_UFOPEDIA: "With our improved netrunning skills and gear, we can now hack the elusive Humanists for any secret info they might be keeping, although it will cost us more resources than hacking the Govts."
  STR_BABY_NUKE_BLUEPRINTS_UFOPEDIA: "It appears that the humans were once in possession of fabled weapons of mass destruction, able to destroy whole cities. They manufactured these weapons from a rare earth element, called 'Uranium'. Tragically, it seems that this exciting technology has been lost forever, and the Star Gods made sure the existing fission weapons stockpiles disappeared. The 'Baby Nukes' we've found are amongst the last of their kind, and their replication seems impossible."
  STR_GNOME_BLUEPRINTS_UFOPEDIA: "Almost imposible to decipher, undoubtedly due to the combined powers of Gnome madness and secretiveness. Still can be passed on to Goblin Zaxx Bank for 200 extra Bounty Tokens."
  STR_SAKURA_BLUEPRINTS_UFOPEDIA: "These parchments contain a selection of cooking recipes, supposedly written by the Demonic Goddess of Love, the Purple Bloom, herself. They range from nice and practical meals to sweet and delicious cakes that, as the Goddess insists, should not only be tasted, but eaten to the last crumb. The rest of the writings contains creepy musings, healing concoctions, and assorted stuff of downright gruesome kind."
  STR_TINY_DRILL_UFOPEDIA: "We finally found some time to poke around the 'Menacing Hull', as you call it. We took the funny drill with us, and... well... The drill seems to be a control part of sorts, or a missing piece of Hull's mechanism we dubbed 'the egg'. When we put it in, the whole machine came to life. There are four insertion ports, which will activate different machine-magics when plugged; however, once the egg is one with the drill, there will be no turning back - the Hull will spend its energies to awaken some properties at the cost of destroying others. What properties? It is beyond our comprehension now, but a 'Codex' that will be produced by the joining will contain the whole knowledge; you can check what we expect of each of them in the 'Treasure' section. Each Codex, among other things, will give us knowledge on how to turn the Hull into a special ship (but to have full understanding of it, we'll need to interrogate some pilots, make test flights, learn basic ship construction and reach a certain education level)."
  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: "Plastasteel is a composite of crystalline steel and carbon nano-fibres, very durable and flexible. It is commonly used for heavy-duty construction. We have developed tools to craft it into more intricate shapes than plain sheets. This should allow us to develop things like better craft hulls and improved personal armor. In the future. When we have access to something more than second-hand goods. Not yet.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 4,500."
  STR_ELERIUM_115_UFOPEDIA: "Nuclear fuel, known to the wise under an arcane name of Isotope 511, is used to power all advanced technology of the Star Gods Empire, like space vessels or energy weapons. While we Earthlings do not know their inner workings, the entire society of Empire-ruled Earth depends on their use. Try to seize your prey while landed to assure securing it.{NEWLINE}Hellerium, especially in the form of fallout, is also important for many creatures, including us, which have learned to metabolize it and thus break normal constraints of physiology. Hellerium is said to naturally occur on some extrasolar planets.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 12k."
  STR_ALIEN_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "These nuclear grenades are secured by a simple electronic lock. By employing a Slave AI, we were able to break the code quite easily and now we can use these grenades at will - they pack quite a punch for their small size."
  STR_SMALL_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "It took us a lot of work to break the genetic lock that disallowed the weapon to be used by those it was not intended for, eg. us. The weapon itself is curious enough, as it uses anti-gravity to launch special Stun Minibombs that are an even greater mystery."
  STR_BOOTLEG_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "While it lacks the range of its Stellar Empire's counterpart, it is still one of the best pistols on the market."
  STR_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "The Stellar Empire plasma weapons are very compact and lack any real trigger or sights. It is magic, baby, and you need to give this pistol a nice rub and a few caring words to get it to shoot. But when it does, it hits hard, quick and with exceptional accuracy."
  STR_ELITE_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "An intricately crafted version of Stellar Empire plasma pistol, plated with Plastagold. Will make a good trophy, as the ammo is hard to get."
  STR_BOOTLEG_PLASMA_SUB_UFOPEDIA: "The Subsidizer sends generous subsidies of plasma to faraway places. Regretfully, the rate of fire suffers, but not so badly because Plasma Subrifle is actually junk."
  STR_PLASMA_SUB_UFOPEDIA: "The Stellar Empire considers this one a second-tier weapon, a dumbed-down, less magical version of a Plasma Rifle. It is often found in the hands of those unworthy to be trusted with better Plasma weapons."
  STR_BOOTLEG_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A solid, strong, futuristic looking rifle. What's not to like? Did you expect better accuracy? Well we don't do magic here!"
  STR_BOOTLEG_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: "Has all the firepower of Stellar Empire's Heavy Plasma and not much in the way of drawbacks, except considerable weight."
  STR_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "This is a devastatingly powerful weapon based on accelerating particles from within a minute anti-gravity field. Standard-issue Stellar Empire weapon, probably existing in like, countless numbers across the galaxy. Don't they ever innovate?"
  STR_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: "This variation of Stellar Empire plasma gun was built for maximum firepower, and that it delivers in abundance. Still light enough to be wielded by any able person, its only shortcoming compared to the Plasma Rifle is slower rate of fire."
  STR_PRECISION_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: "Elite forces' plasma weapon which is insanely difficult to operate due to its sophisticated interface. Once mastered, though, it fully lives up to its name."
  STR_ATGM_UFOPEDIA: "The Anti Tank Guided Missile was developed to kill heavily armored vehicles with unmatched precision. Up to 3 'way points' can be set for the missile to follow, thus allowing seemingly impossible shots. When you have positioned enough way points click on the special launch icon.{NEWLINE}Enemy Armor reduced to 60%.{NEWLINE}Minimum safe range = 15; 200% Accuracy when Kneeling."
  STR_BLASTER_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "Stellar Empire's infantry support weapon. It's better than any other portable launcher, so we call it Bustier Launcher. It fires powerful missiles, guided by YOUR MIND. When you click to fire the weapon it will generate up to 7 'way points' for the missile to follow. When you have positioned enough way points click on the special launch icon.{NEWLINE}The dispersed Hellerium cloud explosion that follows is extremely good at damaging armor (extra damage = 15% of hit's power)"
  STR_CANNONS_MANUFACTURING_2_UFOPEDIA: "There is no easy way to buy craft weapons on the black market - they're strictly regulated. And getting a custom-made weapon onto an airframe is certainly harder than just bolting it to the hull. At least if you want it to work. Long story short, now we can, and nobody can do anything about it. These weapons are called 'light' but remember, that even 50mm cannons are huge compared to personal arms and we better stock up a lot of material if you want to manufacture them."
  STR_CANNONS_MANUFACTURING_3_UFOPEDIA: "It's not an easy task, figuring out how to fit a huge gun onto a flying craft, how to prevent it from being torn off during firing, or damaging the airframe... Just a tiny sample of the troubles we had to overcome. But are we complaining? Of course not! With this technology, we can start fitting Naval Guns to our vessels, and in time develop other, hopefully even more devastating craft weapons."
  STR_CANNONS_MANUFACTURING_4_UFOPEDIA: "Today, we have developed Plastasteel and Aqua munitions to use with cannons. Tomorrow... who knows?"
  STR_CRAFT_MISSILES_UFOPEDIA: "We've figured out how to make missiles equipped with advanced guidance systems, which means long range and high accuracy. Once we know how, all it takes is to refit and repair old Stingray missiles, commonly found in junkyards (as missiles are generally considered an obsolete weapon). All very nice, but where are we going to get advanced electronics from, you ask? It's as simple as gutting Slave AI systems. One should be enough for a dozen of missiles. The remaining odds and ends we can procure by disassembling advanced handheld weapons."
  STR_DANCER_SLAVE_UFOPEDIA: "With no path of true self-improvement, Ars Amandi gets tiresome after a while even for such connoisseurs of bodily pleasures as our Courtesans - or maybe, especially for them. With a little bit of Glamour and some VooDoo training, they can become real artists, dazzling the crowds with their sensual displays. Gladiatrices, already skilled with the crowd and deadly dance, can apply for this job as well.{NEWLINE}Exotic Dancers earn us $42k monthly, while having the same living arrangements as Courtesans. They can be only trained in a Hideout housing a Luxury Spa."
  STR_SQUIRE_UFOPEDIA: "Workshop Code: sq{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 0.5{NEWLINE}Don't say these boys don't work hard, Cap'n! They're really trying but consider all the time they're being distracted by our crew in common home clothing, and all the research we need to do on them! Yes, I agree they should be punished - do you want squires delivered to your quarters like everyone else? Or will it be hopefully a public punishment...?{NEWLINE}Ugh, but I tell you, these boys can become something more in time, I'm sure of it!"
  STR_SLAVE_UFOPEDIA: "Workshop Code: S{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 1{NEWLINE}Captured enemy males who lack any valuable skills are put to simple menial work at our hideout, which translates into extra 1 point of storage space. Not everyone is fit to be a slave; some captives are too headstrong and dangerous to risk it, while also being uninterested in any special accommodations we can realistically provide. Some are simply too weak. Some, like civilians or high government officials, have to be spared this fate on politi... on the moral grounds."
  STR_SLAVE_MAID_UFOPEDIA: "Workshop Code: s{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 0.75{NEWLINE}Captured females without any special skills are turned into maids, to keep the base generally tidier and cater to our every whim. Still we don't drive them as hard as male slaves, because they're gals like us, right? Yeah, right."
  STR_SLAVE_SKILLED_UFOPEDIA: "Workshop Code: S+{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 4.5{NEWLINE}Enemies with good technical expertise are hard to find. We have to value them highly and treat them better than normal slaves, but even with less work hours, their contribution to a Hideout's economy is a major one - who else would repair all that fancy hi-tech equipment? Especially if the alternative is some quality bath time?"
  STR_SLAVE_MANAGER_UFOPEDIA: "Workshop Code: ${NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 8{NEWLINE}These slaves are the pride of any hideout, hence we don't spare any expense on their fancy clothing. They can help us greatly with all administrative and logistic work, and, being females, are prettier, uh, I mean, can be trusted to some degree, as long as we can provide them with good accommodations."
  STR_SLAVE_BRUTE_UFOPEDIA: "Workshop Code: S@{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 2.5{NEWLINE}Not all slaves are agreeable with our arrangements, but some intimidation and little punishment works wonders in changing that attitude. All the better if this job can be relegated to the slaves themselves. Some of our strong enemies are perfectly fit and quite willing to take the position, once properly encouraged - we only have to keep them from being overzealous."
  STR_SLAVE_X_UFOPEDIA: "Instead of toying around with X, we can pass an Enslavement Sentence on her. This is definitely a safer idea, and now we know what buttons to push to make her accept this fate. We expect that such an exceptional slave will have a work efficiency of 76, considering the multitude of her uses, as well as her physical and magical abilities. Also we can probably use these tits of hers to process us Zombie Juice from Hellerium. I bet she'd even enjoy being used like that."
  STR_SLAVE_GLADIATRIX_UFOPEDIA: "Workshop Code: S^{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 3.5{NEWLINE}There is money to be earned from gladiatorial combat, not even mentioning the fun, so these pit-fighters are an important part of our slave enterprise, and the Smugglers deliver fancy gladiatorial gear. Besides, such a fate serves these tenacious harlots just right."
  STR_SLAVE_MAGICAL_UFOPEDIA: "Workshop Code: S*{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 12{NEWLINE}One of the rarest kind of slaves are enemy mages. They have to be kept under constant surveillance, but can greatly contribute to our economy with some of their powers - when equipped with expensive, prisoner-grade psionic gear we get from the Smugglers. Letting them wear anything else is just too dangerous. And they don't deserve it anyway, considering the pain they were in combat!"
  STR_YEOMAN_UFOPEDIA: "Work Efficiency: 1.75{NEWLINE}It's time for our boys to grow up and support our rising empire!{NEWLINE}With the help of our Runts, we will school them in the arts of knavery and combat. How do we do it? We send them to some haunted place, they kill whatever's there and return with loot."
  STR_FARMHOUSE_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}First we learned from the Peasants, now we can introduce our former slaves into farmer's life. With much better tools, mobility and sustainable power. We'll get $75k monthly contribution and 25 storage outsourced per each V. F."
  STR_SLAVE_MAID_SUPER_UFOPEDIA: "Work Efficiency: 4{NEWLINE}With some magic, we're able to turn our Slave Maids into a powerful and gorgeous workforce, basically tripling their value. We need a Luxury Spa at our Hideout to perform the proper training."
  STR_SLAVE_SERVITOR_UFOPEDIA: "Work Efficiency: 100{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Automated drones are more effective than slaves. Slave Taskmasters can be equipped with cybernetics and trained to command them (Workshop & Surgery needed). They will become a nice addition to our Hideout's shantytown."
  STR_SLAVE_ROBOT_UFOPEDIA: "Work Efficiency: 6{NEWLINE}This robotic servant might be more temperamental and feisty than a well-trained living slave (maybe because of the bad people who programmed it, which be us), but it works much harder."
  STR_SLAVE_SKILLED_TRAINING_UFOPEDIA: "Now that we have a solid grasp on manufacturing and scholarly techniques, we can have the Runts train up our Slaves to a Specialist level... at the price of a substantial investment. Only a Hideout that has Mess Hall, Library and Workshop can conduct this type of training."
  STR_LIFTER_UFOPEDIA: "An ubiquitous device, found in ships, housing, transport platforms etc, characterized by a red, green or blue glow. Its magics seem to work by locally altering the force of gravity, aka the same force that makes a vessel with blasted engines crash down to Earth, or a kicked midget crash down the stairs. After some meditations on the nature of these magics, which involved smoking strange stuff while sitting inside an old engine and talking about arcane subjects while wearing next to nothing, we feel we have a much better understanding of the machine-spirits that make them work. Also, a cryptic message for you: 'Don't Stand On Lifters During Takeoff'."
  STR_DECLOAKING_DEVICE_UFOPEDIA: "This device is apparently able to pierce through the cloaking of our craft. As for how it works, or how indeed it could possibly work, we haven't the slightest idea. Must be evil Narlock magic."
  STR_PRISMATIC_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "A device found on a Sky Ninja ship. A weird type of craft shield that is seemingly weak, but it always fully blocks a single attack, no matter how powerful. This is seriously weird and we believe it is cursed. However, it still gave us a few insights into how forcefields work (or rather, how they should NOT work)."
  STR_SHADOW_COMMUNICATOR_UFOPEDIA: "This imposing and ominous device is a piece of technology that does not belong to our universe. The fact this Shadowtech is used by Smugglers to communicate with Shadowmasters is rather obvious. Less obvious was the fact that the device is not sending or receiving any waves, but actually creates a temporary Tannhauser Gate through which not only information, but also those possessing the power of Shadowmasters, can travel. A disturbance of this device leads to its explosive destruction."
  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "The heart of any ship is an anti-matter reactor which uses Hellerium (Isotope 511) to generate powerful gravity waves as well as other forms of energy.  The conversion of matter to energy is an incredible 99% efficient, therefore tiny quantities of Hellerium can produce a huge amount of power. Now we have a better understanding of how to tweak this power to our needs."
  STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "This semi-sentient, highly-adaptable 'drone AI' is a crucial component of any vessel, but it is used for great many other tasks too, like managing enviro controls, supervising assembly lines or even commanding automated vehicles. The inner workings of this device are too arcane to fathom, but we have gained enough understanding of it to custom-tailor its input, peripherals and interface to receive desired output."
  STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "From the schematics we have procured, we have learned that military-class ships are constructed in a wholly different way, around a hardened plastasteel frame laced with super-conductive wiring for heat dissipation that gives them their toughness, as well as allows them to endure high speeds and accelerations within a planet's atmosphere.{NEWLINE}Tougher ships will have the ARMOR parameter; armor negates an amount of damage equal to its rating after each hit, making small weapons less useful against them."
  STR_ALIEN_FOOD_UFOPEDIA: "The life support systems of the Stellar Empire rely on custom-tailored microbes that feed directly on electrical energy. They rapidly break down the body refuse of complex organisms and produce nutrients, clean water and breathable air. Here we have pictured a curious practice of dumping dead bodies into the life support tanks to quickly produce large amounts of nutrients, but this particular use seems pointless (besides some terror value) - why waste perfectly fine meat? Anyway, with this knowledge, we have a crucial stepping stone towards enviro-sealed suits and vessels."
  STR_ALIEN_REPRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "This is the Holy Grail of medical technology - a vat where a desired body part, or even a whole new body, can be rapidly grown, healed, or upgraded. Expensive and sought-after, it can provide anything from being simply a convenient medical device to creating virtual demigods. The device we obtained is only a minor version of a true RETEGES Chamber, but is enough to study the underlying tech."
  STR_ALIEN_ENTERTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "These strange, alluring wall panels contain strange, crystal circuitry, and cause effects similar to hallucinogenic drugs. We can only describe the effects as magic. Be sure to advise your hands not to look at them for too long. These panels, naturally, are highly valued on the market, but, if we dare, we can also rip out the circuitry to put it in devices of our own making. Not like we have the slightest idea how and if it would work."
  STR_ALIEN_SURGERY_UFOPEDIA: "This fully self-contained unit uses laser cutters, EM devices and other arcane technology to perform sophisticated medical procedures almost as simply as pushing a button. It can however also be used to other ends, such as interrogations or working with organic-like synthetic technology."
  STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "The purpose of this device is to scan the minuscule structure of materials and replicate it. With one installed in our Lab, we can fool around with it, but the actual expertise needs to be learned from Trader and Academy Engineers. Then, to use it in practice, a suitable workshop type needs to be developed."
  STR_ALIEN_HABITAT_UFOPEDIA: "These pods are used to keep the occupant in suspended animation. They're often outfitted with medical devices as well. This technology is crucial for space travel, as it allows ship crew to sleep for years while aging only days."
  STR_SMUGGLED_ELECTRONICS: "Optronics Smuggling"
  STR_SMUGGLED_ELECTRONICS_UFOPEDIA: "Turns out we uncovered quite a sensation - there appears to be some kind of manufacturing center of Optronics here, on Earth, run by the Technocracy. The Smugglers have some top secret links with this business, which allows them to snatch the Optronics right at the source, at a fraction of the price. What's curious is that the Guild has no direct control over this, they're just a buyer. The merchandise is anyway rumored to be produced in such quantities that most of it is shipped to far-off planets of the Stellar Empire."
  STR_MARS_BACKGROUND: "Life on Mars"
  STR_MARS_BACKGROUND_UFOPEDIA: "Humans colonized Mars centuries ago, with the help of Star God technology. However, the terraforming efforts have so far not yielded much, and aren't supposed to for a few millenia. As of now, humans live in airtight settlements, heated by the power of Hellerium and fed by greenhouse grown food. Mars has millions of inhabitants, and, excluding a few areas reserved by the Star Gods, is run by Guild and Marsec."
  STR_PARADISE_WORLDS: "Paradise Worlds"
  STR_PARADISE_WORLDS_UFOPEDIA: "The richest provinces of the Stellar Empire are famous for their pleasure resorts, where multitudes of alien races mingle, party and trade in mind-boggling luxury. However, only the Mercenaries, Smugglers and VIPs can get there from Earth, as it requires access to long-distance space travel."
  STR_INTERSTELLAR_TRAVEL_SUMMARY: "Interstellar Travel"
  STR_INTERSTELLAR_TRAVEL_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA: "The Stellar Empire employs so-called 'Warping' to travel between nearby stars in a matter of weeks. Longer distance travel involves deep space oddities, known as 'black holes', hosting 'jump gates'. The closest warp ships are on Mars: Transstellar hellerium freighters and Marsec deep space fighters, but even they cannot Jump. This is only done by the vast Imperial galleons. The Smugglers conduct their interstellar business by stealing hikes on these, by bribery, stealth or otherwise. Aside from trade goods, these ships sometimes carry Mercs, but never Star Gods themselves."
  STR_WARP_DRIVE: "Warp Drive"
  STR_WARP_DRIVE_UFOPEDIA: "The benign name conceals an idea that borders on sheer insanity - or, actually, is well beyond that border. Interstellar travel is limited by the speed of light. Even if you could somehow breach it, it could create a casuality paradox - you would basically be travelling back in time.{NEWLINE}The Warp Drive utilizes the uncertainty principle. Any material object is a quantum wave, and it is impossible to pinpoint its exact speed and position at the same time. The warp drive spirits the ship away from the observable universe, therefore making its position uncertain. Then the ship can reappear anywhere. The insane part is, it is impossible to tell where and when exactly it will reappear, and how much time it will take. Only if no observer of both its departure and arrival exists, can the ship reappear without creating a time paradox. Thus the longer distance one travels, the more predictable it is. So WHERE are you, when you're warping? It is commonly described as a 'dream world', where notions of time and space become uncertain."
  STR_PRIZE_BATTO_MAGIC: "Prize: Powerball Bat"
  STR_PRIZE_BATTO_MAGIC_UFOPEDIA: "Our reputation as gals who wouldn't shy away from hunting demons and zombies while wearing next to nothing was awarded by this prize by the Wizards.. Strange guys, these Wizards...{NEWLINE}(Item Added: Powerball Bat; we can commission more with Wiz Biz tokens)"
  STR_PRIZE_UBER_001: "Arm Wrestling Match"

She was only hiding her true identity, which is a genetically engineered assassin who escaped her masters several years ago. With some efforts, the Brainers can win her trust. After the completion of 'claim' research, there will be no report, instead we will get her into our custody. After this, she can be recruited through Workshop, or sold out to her former masters for a fistful of Dolaros."

  STR_ALIEN_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "A few small ships of one or another Faction will fly to-and-fro (normally Runabouts and Cutters), and we can bring them down. Or ignore them. If we bring down too many, they're very likely to abort the mission."
  STR_ALIEN_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA: "Resistance against the activities of most factions is nothing new, and the most direct way of dealing with it is a military action. After a preliminary wave of Escorts, Gunships and Fighters, the dreaded Bombers are sent to impose fear, or, if the need arises, deliver oblivion to their hapless victims. These missions, if successful, will noticeably decrease our notoriety, but it is difficult to stop them - as it means going toe-to-toe with man'o'wars in the air, there are no landings."
  STR_ALIEN_ABDUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "While a general resistance is best dealt with an overwhelming force, sometimes a more surgical approach is needed. Pacification features scouting and fly-bys by Fighters and Escorts, and when the areas of unrest are pinpointed, Gunships, Terror Ships and Envoys deliver elite troops to deal with the offenders on the ground, with extreme prejudice. Success of such missions will decrease our notoriety, but we can try beating them up until they relent."
  STR_ALIEN_ABDUCTION_PIR_UFOPEDIA: "A Commercial activity performed throughout the Stellar Empire on alien planets inhabited by pre-spacefaring species. Specimens of local sentient races are ambushed and stunned, to be carried off into space. Usually the utmost care is taken to not overtly damage the prisoner, and escape unseen. Any witnesses are either abducted as well, or destroyed with superior weapons. Abductees are then used either for study, documentation, or direct sale in one of Empire's commercial hubs."
  STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_UFOPEDIA: "Sometimes rich people travel around the planet in luxury yachts. Catching one is like free cash."
  STR_MISSION_SWAY_GOVT_UFOPEDIA: "This mission is aimed at attacking our funding base. As you know, the local governments balance between cooperating with the big factions (and by extension, the Star Gods) and respecting the needs of the population and the voice of the Mutant Alliance. Here, a faction aims at coercing (i.e. threatening) one or another local govt into being 'tough on crime' and taking more direct steps against felons like us. Our enemies are the big Factions, and by extension, the Star Gods themselves, so you can bet on the targeted local govt to eventually succumb, sever any ties with us and stop paying us protection money - forever. Our best shot at stopping this is shooting down the Courier with dignitaries. If this fails, the mission will succeed."
  STR_ALIEN_BASE_UFOPEDIA: "Sometimes, the factions build underground bases in secluded areas of the planet, where they can perform any activity that's best left unknown to the population at large (and their competition). However, this secluded location gives us an opportunity to strike, loot the place and disappear into the sunset before massive reinforcements can arrive. On the other hand, each existing Secret Base steadily undermines our position (-10 Infamy daily). A Secret Base is bound to be filled with loot, information (which we can use to blackmail people and otherwise increase our global standing), and is a prime place to look for the highest-ranking members of a faction. The final stages of building a base are signified with massed Supply Ship, Frigate and Cruiser activity that lasts for a couple of days."
  STR_ALIEN_TERROR_UFOPEDIA: "These 'surgical raids' against 'terrorist leaders' are a sad reality of our times. From time to time, a faction sends its death squads to one city or another to, as it turns out from our interrogation, 'cull the mutant numbers a little as they're breeding too fast anyway'. We can thwart such an attempt early, simply by shooting Terror Ships down, but waiting out and making a surprise appearance at the party can potentially garner us more respect (unless we let too many locals die). In some cases, attackers don't use ships and come by land instead. In such events, the Mutant Alliance will dispatch a Hyperwave distress call. Whether we care about the hapless fools who get massacred or not, it's always an opportunity to grab some loot and fame."
  STR_ALIEN_RETALIATION_UFOPEDIA: "If we shoot down someone's shippings, they will send their man'o'wars looking for us. Our ships are employing cloaking technology, and the hideouts are - well, hidden, but with enough luck and effort they can still be discovered, especially those which are used to launch interceptions. Our enemies are likely to fail and make idiots of themselves anyway, but if they don't, expect them to arrive numerous and armed to the teeth. On the bright side, if we kick their asses, their policy is to cover the failure up and they won't return anytime soon. A Crackdown is performed by ships like Sentries, Fighters, Gunships and Cruisers. If any of them manages to get within about 100 miles from our hideout, expect a landing ship coming fast at it very soon. There are 5 variants of these ships, and some will break easily through any feasible AA defenses, but once the enemy gets boots on the ground, the advantage is ours. The enemy will only be able to deploy in Hangars and the Access Lift."
  STR_ALIEN_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA: "Wherever a Secret Base exists, it needs to be constantly supplied. Tracking a supply run to its landing zone is a sure-fire way to find a Secret Base. We should be wary, though: the owners know that their flights are easily predicted, and have made precautions against thieves. They will fight to the death, knowing that their ship is rigged to explode, if they cannot defeat the enemy swiftly enough."
  STR_MISSION_FREIGHT_UFOPEDIA: "The Traders' Guild is the biggest cargo transporting company by far, constantly moving stuff around the planet. They not only maintain their own supply chain, but also take a lot of government contracts for moving least-to-moderately important stuff. So many Freighters are operating at once that the Guild cannot protect them all, and they're not very well armed themselves, so consider them fair game! Just think about all the expensive stuff inside, waiting for us. Freighters have moderately big crews, but they're mostly weak and cowardly, so we should just capture and sell them. However, Freighters rarely land in the wilderness, so we need to shoot them down else they'll land in cities, out of our reach."
  STR_MISSION_HEAVY_FREIGHT_UFOPEDIA: "In response to increasing danger to their trade routes (in no small part due to us), the Guild decided to step up their defensive measures. From now on, we can expect the amount of normal traffic to decrease, in favour of Heavy Freighter flights. The presence of such imposing vessels is sure to increase the perception of the Guild's power, thus each successful mission of this type will cost us 500 points of Notoriety."
  STR_MISSION_MINING_UFOPEDIA: "Mining ships make easy, if not too valuable targets. They survey an area then proceed to extract valuable minerals, which takes a few days. These missions are flown by various factions, mostly Traders but also the Academy and local govts - so be sure whom you're killing while on the ground. Mining ships always perform prolonged landings in the wild, that's where they're easy to attack."
  STR_MISSION_GOLD_TRANSPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Both the Govts and Traders conduct these highly interesting missions. After a few fly-bys of Gunboats, an armored Freighter will appear, filled with very valuable cargo. It won't land in any accessible location, so our only chance to get the loot is to shoot it down. However, if we shoot down the Gunboats first, the flight might be canceled, so we gotta be careful."
  STR_MISSION_MILITARY_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA: "These missions are flown by Spartans, Raiders, Govt. After watching several Light Gunboats circling around, watch out for the main dish - a Military Transport, laden with low-tech but plentiful military gear. It can be blown out of the sky, but definitely has to eventually stop somewhere, and for a fair duration."
  STR_MISSION_COURIER_UFOPEDIA: "Academy, Guild and Church sometimes need to transport important people and parcels quickly. Such courier missions are usually performed using small, fast ships, which have little in the way of defense but are so fast that catching up with them could be a problem. Still, if we do manage to do so, they are pretty much defenseless, both in the air and on the ground. Such ships are good opportunities to find rare goods and valuable prisoners. However, if we shoot down their escorts, the courier run might be canceled."
  STR_MISSION_CONVERSION_UFOPEDIA: "The so-called Conversion Missions are one of the staple operations of the Church. Once they hear a rumour of a community whose level of faith is unsatisfactory, they get to work. First, they send out Gunships to pinpoint the offenders and subdue any resistance. Once this phase is completed, Shrine Ships appear to perform the usual shock and awe faith-strengthening procedure. In this latter phase, the Church is more vulnerable to our attacks. On the other hand, successful Conversions lower people's belief in things like Pirates, which is not good."
  STR_MISSION_SUPERVISION_UFOPEDIA: "From time to time, the Star Gods show up on Earth to keep the tabs on current going-ons and ensure no-one is breaking their rules. Their ways are always mysterious, as their vessels do not make landings during this mission; either they have means of supervising without direct contact (after all, they have many spies), or they're simply not that much interested in this backwater planet. The Supervisions are flown by Messengers, Envoys and Cruisers."
  STR_MISSION_PASSENGER_UFOPEDIA: "Passenger flights are mainly operated by the Traders Guild, but Academicians also maintain their own, smaller network. Most ordinary purebloods that need to travel buy tickets from them. Such flights are performed by cheap, insignificant ships that pose little danger to us. If we shoot down one such vessel, we can expect to fight many people, but most of them aren't much of a threat. However there is one fine point: do not expect such an attack to be particularly popular if you slaughter and capture civilians (Trader personnel is free game). Passenger ships land mostly in cities, so it's often required to shoot them down to get them."
  STR_MISSION_SURVEY_UFOPEDIA: "Survey missions are conducted by The Academy to monitor all sorts of activities on Earth, ranging from vegetation to human activity. During these missions they gather samples of plants, animals and people to conduct experiments on them. They also abduct any local mages they can find. We can ignore these missions, as they don't hurt us at all, but on the other hand we can take these ships down and take them apart, so why not do so?"
  STR_MISSION_DIPLOMACY_UFOPEDIA: "The Academy, The Guild and the Church need to maintain close ties to the govts - or more like, keep the govts under their thumb. Diplomatic missions are crucial to this, and they are conducted periodically. They represent little threat to us, but they are an opportunity to capture someone important. Shooting down the escorts makes it very likely for the mission to be canceled, so maybe we should wait for the Courier?"
  STR_MISSION_MERCENARY_ASSIGNMENT_UFOPEDIA: "The Mercenaries conduct their dirty business all year long. Generally they're of little threat to us... unless we cross them. They fly deadly vessels like Heavy Gunships or Frigates and are armed to the teeth. Shooting down any of these ships, even if successful, is assured to have repercussions."
  STR_MISSION_RAID_UFOPEDIA: "Raids are usually organized by Raiders, sometimes by Spartans. They normally choose targets that are away from any settlements, preferably defenseless peasants. Raid parties rarely have good weapons, but they make up for this with numbers and tenacity. Killing raiders isn't enormously profitable, but everybody has to start somewhere, right? At least the chance of Raiders mounting a Crackdown mission in response are very low."
  STR_MISSION_GOVT_PATROL_UFOPEDIA: "The truth is, Govt ships can be recognized simply by red-and-blue lights they bear (normally Fighters and Ordinators). The provincial govts mind their business, and they pay us our racket money, so it's kinda faux pas to attack them, but their bigger craft carry valuable booty, so it's your choice, Cap'n!"
  STR_MISSION_SMUGGLING_UFOPEDIA: "There are a lot of goods which are strictly regulated, or only available for the outrageous Trader's Guild's prices. Smuggling is the answer. Smuggling ships carry a lot of valuable (and sometimes unique) merchandise, but they're seriously souped-up to avoid interception - by the officials, or just simple folks who want to get rid of the middleman. Er, that be us, Cap'n."
  STR_ACTIVITIES_MILITARY_UFOPEDIA: "You have learned all there is to know about Military missions. Your tactical genius is unmatched.{NEWLINE}(Increased influence - 1000 points awarded)"
  STR_ACTIVITIES_ENTERPRISE_UFOPEDIA: "You have learned just about everything about modern Enterprising. Now you'll be always one step ahead of the competition.{NEWLINE}(Increased influence - 1000 points awarded)"
  STR_ACTIVITIES_COMMERCIAL_UFOPEDIA: "You have learned the inside outs of all Commercial activities. You have become a street legend.{NEWLINE}(Increased influence - 1000 points awarded)"
  STR_ACTIVITIES_POLITICAL_UFOPEDIA: "You have gained the full understanding of Political activities. Your spies are everywhere.{NEWLINE}(Increased influence - 1000 points awarded)"
  STR_MISSION_REBEL_TRADING_UFOPEDIA: "Through sharing our manufacturing methods with the low classes of the world, we have managed to undermine the economical standing of Star Gods' servants. Rebel Freighters, run either by the Mutant Alliance or Provincial Govt, are starting to create an independent trade. This mission will run every month, replacing some Faction activities, and generating up to 1000 points towards our Infamy."
  STR_BLACKMARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The inhabitants of this country are known for their combat mettle and fierce pride. They prefer rural life, as large cities tend to draw heavy artillery fire. Same goes for organized infrastructure - forest pathways and animal transport makes poor targets for bombing. Many have taken the locals for unwashed and uneducated primitives, which appears only to be partly true, as the country has not only held off several invasions through their combination of guerrilla warfare and expert military training, but was even able to expand its territories, and it could perhaps become a major power if not for the locals' very vocal distrust in any form of peacetime government or their inability to conform to any non-military rules or regulations. Only two cities can be found in this land - sprawling Free City where the locals convene to form their Parliament, and an imposing fortress, The Bastion, serving as a bulwark against Bad Things that dwell in the south."
  STR_CALIFORNIA_REPUBLIC_UFOPEDIA: "Known for its peculiar political system, called 'democracy', as well as for being the world's leading power in movie production. Their ruler, called a 'President', is always chosen by the general vote (voting is easy, as all TV sets have touchscreens) from the most popular movie stars in a monthly poll; the poll also decides what to do with the former president, a popular choice being 'death on the stage' (the local movie industry prides itself that no effects are faked). In this land of the free, there is no police and little government, so the order is enforced by highly fanatical death-squads of a fully hermetic (through the feat of inbreeding) Hubbologist Order. It is only natural that the leaders of this organization, engaged in such ungrateful and hard work take two-thirds of everyone else's earnings. After all, they don't revere Dollar the Allmighty for nothing."
  STR_CENTRAL_PROVINCE_UFOPEDIA: "With almost a hundred million citizens, the Central Province is the most populous country on the planet. Its rulers boast about their unshakeable loyalty to the Empire. Their belief is that rule of the superiors over inferiors is the divine order of things, and when the Star Gods arrived, it was only natural to pledge allegiance. They also claim that their land is the most beloved by the Star Gods. The question if the Star Gods can feel any love remains open, but there's no doubt the Central Province has been loved quite roughly and thoroughly; most of it is a cratered death zone, rendered uninhabitable by chemical, biological and nuclear contamination, not even mentioning strange monsters and other, bizarre and unexplained phenomena. Less influenced areas (which doesn't mean safe) are inhabited by dirt-poor peasants, struggling to harvest enough rice to feed relatively more fortunate inhabitants of underground cities. Strangely, the locals do not complain too much, maybe because complaining can make you an organ donor."
  STR_CONFEDERATION_UFOPEDIA: "The Confederation is the bread basket of the world, their humongous agriculture powered by equally humongous numbers of slaves (their main import and close to 80% of the population). No effort was spared (including unsurprisingly many, many slaves' lives) to learn how to domesticate (and turn profit on) vicious forms of fauna and flora like Cowyotes, Tentacle Vines or Carnocorn. With the passage of centuries, the success, as the plantation owners agree over a glass of the finest moonshine, has been spectacular. The Confederation has no real central government other than a loose board of wealthiest grandees, but they're rich enough to buy the best guns and mercenaries, and the free people, for the lack of daily burdens, are all well trained in combat. And perhaps most importantly, each of the Confederation's neighbors currently has too much on their own plate to think about invading, with the possible exception of the Latin Empire."
  STR_DARK_DOMINION_UFOPEDIA: "This country is ruled by a shadowy council of eight Masked Mages. The population, numbering over 70 million, is considerably well off, living mostly in small towns and agricultural communities. The wealth of the country, both in tech and money is pretty considerable. So why such an ominous name, a child would ask? The Mages, backed by a huge, fanatical cult, openly worship what they call the 'Dark Gods'. And the ways of worship are many - starting with a huge number of taboos (like the ban on motorized vehicles), naturally punished by a painful death, ending with, what else, mass human sacrifices. Strangely enough, this system seems to be working, as the Deep Ones do not bother locals too much, and even the Church of Sirius usually avoids these parts of the planet. Aside from their strange religion and dark magics, the Dominion is known for its mastery in production of various mind-altering drugs, both widely used by the locals and exported abroad (if the Mages allow)."
  STR_DEATH_REALMS_UFOPEDIA: "Names are often misleading. But not in this case. The whole country is a blasted wasteland that's out to kill you. The wildlife consists of giant, poisonous scorpions, giant, poisonous spiders, giant, poisonous plants... you're probably starting to see the pattern. And if you avoid those, there is always plentiful and deadly UV radiation. There are four heavily fortified cities that host close to 20 million population. Not to be outdone by the local nature, the rulers devised an ingenious way to simultaneously deal with overcrowding, low morale, poverty and scarcity of food supplies: televised death games, played either in death arenas, death mazes, death pits or plainly on city streets. The participants are chosen at random. There is big money to be won (and being rich means food and clean air), but most of the contestants end up murdered (extra points are rewarded for creative kills) and thrown into nutrient-recycling vats. Somehow, few outsiders show any interest in this merry land."
  STR_EURASIAN_AUTONOMY_UFOPEDIA: "Since this area of the world stood the most defiant against the Star Gods invasion, it has been thoroughly brutalized by both the Gods and their human proxies. After a hundred years or so of not-entirely-successful operation, the Star Gods finally called quits and left the few remaining local survivors to their own devices. The modern day EA is a part of the Star Gods province system, but, while basically a non-actor on the international scene, with the leadership corrupted by one or another foreign power, it has a reputation of a 'land where nothing can be done' - doing business there is subjecting yourself to endless delays, incompetence, robbery, shoddy workmanship, unforeseen difficulties and so on... Strangely, all the attempts of civilizing this seemingly weak country ended in tears, up to and including mysterious explosions of atomic bombs, which, supposedly, were all long since scrapped by the Star Gods."
  STR_EUROSYNDICATE_UFOPEDIA: "An industrial and technological powerhouse with over 80 million citizens, this corporate state is the wealthiest on the planet, hampered as it might be by infighting and the universal ban on global travel all local govts have to adhere to. While Europe bore the brunt of a nuclear war fought in the early days of Star Gods occupation, the Eurosyndicate rose from the ashes, building enclosed cities with intricate filtration systems and virtual reality networks. Food is grown in great underground caverns and is reportedly quite edible. That's all perhaps enough to sweeten universal debt-slavery and incessant shootouts between police, corporate forces and criminals (in varied configurations), none of whom care too much about collateral damage. The elites live in luxury, surrounded by their famous gen-engineered servants and infamous cybernetic hitmen, and quietly dream about dominating the globe."
  STR_FUSO_UFOPEDIA: "Whatever international standing Fuso has comes only from its rich and sprawling capitol of Sunrise, where most of its technology and wealth is concentrated under the watchful eye of the Emperor and a host of industrial cartels. But their power ends about a dozen paces off the city limits, and the rest of this scarcely populated land is torn by incessant warfare between local warlords, over the years relying more and more on medieval weapons because ammo costs money. Average locals haven't even heard of electricity. Unsurprisingly, the country is mostly known for its swords, martial arts and ars moriendi."
  STR_GHOSTGATES_UFOPEDIA: "Rumours say the country is haunted, and if you take a wrong turn, you could find a vampire or worse. Legend has it, just after conquering the Earth, the Star Gods had to curb excess population levels of that time, so they resettled billions of people from the whole Euroasia onto the isolated subcontinent, only to destroy them with a host of nasty plagues, some killing outright, some causing slow agony, some putting people in a death-like state or doing even more bizarre things. While the notion that there could ever be a billion people living on the planet (let alone multiple billions) seems a bit of a stretch, Ghostgates is definitely spooky, with its endless old boneyards and ruins, scattered throughout lush jungles , and its silent, big-eyed inhabitants, living in dozens of disparate counties and towns. Not to mention that the five aristocratic families of old, who have the right to elect the local Patriarch, could well be the vampires of legend judging by their looks and decadence."
  STR_HIDDEN_EXPANSE_UFOPEDIA: "The African continent was very rich and populous in the ages of yore, but all that ended with the Deep Ones invasion. The chaos they brought emboldened the local wild Sectoid tribes and attracted all kinds of freaks of nature, insane enough to worship the Deep Ones' gods (which might be less dangerous than the Star Gods, probably, but are certainly much crazier). The 15 or so million people who still hold on to this rump of a state are well-fortified, determined and never far from their flamethrowers and artillery pieces. Those who can afford it, generally flee, usually to find disenchantment abroad - despite all the danger, it is said that the Knight-Generals who rule the Hidden Expanse keep reasonable order, with the execution rate almost on par with the homicide rate, which is a feat by itself."
  STR_INDONESIA_UFOPEDIA: "A teeming country ruled by a dynamic (read: much bloodshed) trust of the most powerful criminal organizations. Exports: pleasure in every form. Imports: military hardware."
  STR_IRON_TRIBE_UFOPEDIA: "While this important, if largely depopulated country can hardly be called a tribe nowadays, the origin of the name can be traced several centuries back, when the isles housed nothing but stone-age tribes. The Iron Tribe had some pre-invasion tech, great ambitions and unmatched tenacity, and, because of that, there eventually were no other tribes anymore. The nation grew rich enough to restore some electrical grid and steam train service - low tech but none the less amazing feats. Most of the population is dispersed throughout fortified villages, separated by large swathes of foreboding wilderness, but for their capitol, the Iron Tribe reclaimed the ancient city of Spectral... which was quite a bold move, as the haunted ruins host a huge, mysterious and seemingly indestructible (not for the lack of tries) transdimensional gate. Regularly there is something unspeakable coming out of it and doing unspeakable things. The well-organized (if lacking heavy equipment) military is usually able to eventually repel such guests, but none of many expeditions sent through the gate ever returned."
  STR_KINGDOM_OF_CANADA_UFOPEDIA: "A very full of itself monarchy, currently ruled by Her Majesty, Queen Aurora the 2nd. Quite nice people, actually, until they stone you to death for smoking tobacco or exposing your thighs in public. The red-uniformed RCF (Royal Canadian Forces) are constantly on alert against Things From The North, Things From The Sea, Generally Indecent People and occasional Technocracy robotic spies. Other than that, a boring place."
  STR_LATIN_EMPIRE_UFOPEDIA: "An old, but recently growing power built on conquest, education, artistic flair and social inequality. After subjugating the surrounding areas and repelling Deep Ones, its eyes more and more often look to the north; the Confederation might not be able to stand up to the might of Imperial Legions, and they have so many slaves that could be used much more efficiently..."
  STR_NORTHERN_FEDERATION_UFOPEDIA: "A bleak place that's relatively well off, which isn't that hard considering the state of neighboring lands. The government tries to manage with what limited resources they have, thus they're enforcing strict population limits. The locals are not really supposed to complain, else they might well be expelled from this heavily-policed paradise on earth and might find themselves on the other side of the border. Multiple layers of barbed wire, interlocking minefields and automated machinegun emplacements, set to shoot anything that moves, make sure that said border is somewhat harder to traverse in the opposite direction."
  STR_RED_REVOLUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Yet another country run by religious whackos, this time having nothing to do with the Star Gods cult, though. The Church of the Red Revolution reveres a prophetic-like figure, Marx Guevara, who is said to have been martyred in between two hundred - two hundred thousand years ago (depending on scripture) and is supposed to come back to deliver all the Revolutionists from evil, and send all the other people to an eternity of creative torment. This joyous event is supposed to happen any day now. Meanwhile the Revolutionists are busy implementing the tenets of their religion (abolition of private property, simple living, helping each other and unquestioningly following orders of the priesthood), chasing sinners (who are then, naturally, subjected to creative cruelty) and frantically arming themselves - not long ago this land was contested between the Latin Empire and the Confederation."
  STR_ROGUE_FIELDS_UFOPEDIA: "This deserted country is divided between a dozen rich, powerful and bombastic warlords, each keeping his own army. While the clashes between those 'Lords of War' as they call themselves, are pretty commonplace, they are united by a common interest: piracy. Large fleets of flying and seaborne ships are ready to strike any country which lowers its guard and run away, cargo bays filled with loot and slaves, before the smoke begins to clear - only to later trade the spoils on the global market, not infrequently to the former owners. The wealth of gold, tech and weapons thus gathered over centuries, along with the geography, protects the Lords from any meaningful retribution, not even mentioning mundane threats like the Deep Ones. The Lords are, naturally, tyrannical, but the locals follow the 'live fast, die young' motto, and when there is no war, ride in the great death-races that are the biggest sports events on the planet. There is no shortage of motorized vehicles either, as the Rogue Fields is the world's top producer of oil-burning machinery, riding, sailing or flying."
  STR_ROMANICA_UFOPEDIA: "The most iconic features of the landscape are numerous stone castles, from small keeps to sprawling fortresses, fortified with every known weapon, up to intercontinental missiles. These castles are ancestral homes to numerous aristocratic families, jointly ruling the land, often clashing, sometimes even warring with each other. The country is mostly deforested and dusty, but still contains huge swathes of agriculture, farmed by local peasants who are often reasonably well off (that is, until some clashing faction sets their houses on fire), but are forbidden to possess any advanced technology. The capital, Ground Zero is mostly neutral zone where the landlords meet to discuss general politics; the families might often hate each other, but they hate the neighboring countries even more. The capital's name comes from the old tale, that during the nuclear war, an ancient city that stood there was hit by the first and biggest warhead of mass destruction. Hardly any ruins remain, and today's city is a place of numerous luxury entertainment establishments."
  STR_STEEL_PACT_UFOPEDIA: "For centuries, the western coastline of South America was home to half-a-dozen piss-poor tiny states, clinging to what little they could harvest from the sea and protected from the Amazonian Deep Ones by the mountains. Those mountains couldn't protect them from the tsunami waves that utterly devastated the tiny states, or from the Dark Dominion which quickly capitalized on neighbor's bad luck by invading them. However, one Commandante Bolivar rose as head of the resistance, and then as head of the alliance, when the occupiers were thrown out. A master of propaganda, he managed to turn this backwater into a land of belching low-tech factories and united nationalistic fervour. It is obvious that the godless Dark Dominion is responsible for all the bad things that happened. Huge contingents of steel tanks and men in black uniforms stand ready to confront the Dominion's superior technology with superior numbers, dedication and tactics. The war can break out at any moment now, especially after everyone suspected of jeopardizing the country's effort, their families and their dogs are exterminated."
  STR_TECHNOCRACY_UFOPEDIA: "Little is known of the inner workings of the Technocracy, as almost no one leaves the country - and those who do, are as clueless as outsiders, speaking of a life in sprawling industrial cities, amongst masses of zombie-like compatriots. There is no question though that the Technocracy is big on all things cybernetic, from surveillance systems to outright robots and cyborgs. As the rulers of the country seem to be completely silent to the outside world, the vision of endless armies of automata setting out some day to conquer the planet is a popular scare in the neighboring lands. However, such an event has yet to happen, and the general consensus is that the Technocracy is ears-deep in internal trouble, caused by social unrest, the heavy tithes the Star Gods demand, and, if you're willing to listen to wilder rumors, by rogue machines."
  STR_THEBAN_TYRANNY_UFOPEDIA: "Not much was happening in this desert country, inhabited by what remained of local Arabic peoples (estimated 95% extinction) until a ruler rose virtually out of the desert sands about two centuries ago. Known as Queen Bee, and styling herself as 'Cleopatra', she imposed her rule with the help of an extremely powerful battlemage (both of them are said to surpass even the Star Gods in sorcery), and kept herself and her most valuable servants alive and youthful through the means of arcane biotechnology. Said biotechnology was also used to breed whole armies of drone soldiers and workers (this not-to-keen-on-thinking crowd now constitutes most of the population) to subjugate surrounding areas. A sole, huge city of Thebes was built in the Nile Valley, and its absolute mistress, sitting on the top of the Silver Pyramid, has her eyes on new conquests... An eventual clash with the currently leading local power, the Eurosyndicate, seems inevitable, meanwhile the rulers of Romanica frantically arm themselves and prepare for the worst."
  STR_TURAN_UFOPEDIA: "The endless, scarcely populated expanses of Central Asia turned out to be cost prohibitive for even the Star Gods to control.  Consequently, the areas stayed mostly untouched by the globe-wide devastation. About three centuries ago a coherent power coalesced out of local nomadic peoples: Turan. Keeping to themselves (both figuratively and literally, as they expertly scavenge whatever technology and servants they can) in this chaotic world, they built a society based on simple, harsh yet relatively just laws, ruled by the strongest warlord from the fortress-city of Karakorum. Most of the population still keeps to their nomadic ways of life, often wandering past Crossroads as far as Romanica to feed their herds and trade. Reputed as fierce warriors, they really don't appreciate strangers meddling in their affairs. Like, head-on-a-pike not appreciate. If you don't offend them, though, they're quite hospitable, they'll feed you and tend to your injuries, just don't be surprised to find yourself relieved of all possessions."

  STR_HISTORY_001_UFOPEDIA: "As the invasion escalated, some Old Earth governments chose to fight the enemy directly. However, attacks with airbreather fighters yielded few successes."
  STR_HISTORY_002_UFOPEDIA: "Eventually, more than a half of human leaders submitted to Star Gods rule. The others remained defiant. This situation lasted for more than a decade, tensions rising, finally culminating with a global nuclear war. The Star Gods stepped in to stop the hostilities, but millions had perished. As the nuclear winter descended, most of the military opposition to the invaders either yielded or was unable to continue organised resistance."
  STR_HISTORY_003_UFOPEDIA: "The Star Gods allowed most loyal human leaders to stay in power, but as decades progressed, little in the way of the wonders they'd promised for the planet had materialized, while Earth was ravaged by waves of strange diseases. Social unrest and rebellion were widespread, only to be brutally put down every time they erupted."
  STR_HISTORY_004_UFOPEDIA: "Even as Earth's population was dwindling to an eventual couple hundred of million, and the planet was ravaged by hunger, disease and poverty, the human elites weren't unhappy. For them and them alone, the Star Gods have mostly kept their side of the bargain: near-immortality, strength, marvelous technology and an absolute power over their serfs."

Most of the planet was eventually depopulated and impoverished, but as centuries passed, plagues receded and stable mutations developed. Tyrants and warlords ruled over the devastated territories, remnants of Old Earth military technology never being a threat to the planet's true masters."
  STR_HISTORY_006_UFOPEDIA: "Early scouting parties appeared on Earth long before its conquest, since the early 1900s. In rare cases when they were ambushed on the ground or at low altitude, the Govts' forces always prevailed. It was therefore theorized that the planet's forces could fight and defeat the Stellar Empire's ground invasion. However, that kind of invasion never happened."
  STR_HISTORY_007_UFOPEDIA: "There were no major ground battles during the invasion, and skirmishes mostly happened when the Star Gods committed terrorist attacks against civilian population. Humans were usually able to fend off such attacks at a high cost of life, but apart from some bits and pieces of alien tech, such victories were irrelevant on the strategical level."
  STR_HISTORY_008_UFOPEDIA: "The most stalwart of all the warriors of the Old Earth were the Knights of Cydonia. The legend has it that when the Earth was already lost to the Stellar Empire, they made an impossible voyage to Mars in a last ditch, desperate attempt to snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat. It is unknown what has become of them."
  STR_HISTORY_009_UFOPEDIA: "The Traders' Guild was at first named Marsec: an organization created to supervise colonies on Mars. After most governments on Earth signed treaties with the Star Gods, they were rewarded with stellar technology, which was used to greatly accelerate aerospace engineering and create a permanent human settlement on Mars. However, since the Red Planet already belonged to the Star Gods in all but name, the Star Gods made a condition that no national outposts could be built on Mars, only Marsec would have that right as a global organization. The governments on Earth reluctantly agreed to the deal and so Marsec became the single most influential human agency. A long time later, after the governments collapsed or became isolated, Marsec became just a part of the Guild, as their influence was expanding both inwards (to Earth) and outwards (with new colonies established)."
  STR_HISTORY_010_UFOPEDIA: "After Earth was flooded with alien artifacts, given to governments by the Star Gods or left after the Majestic 12 were dissolved, a vibrant black market for these goods soon emerged. A vast, global network of ruthless individuals who knew where to get the alien stuff and how to sell it well. This network was an arena of struggle between several criminal cartels, and the last one standing was known as Osiron. With this, Osiron became the biggest player on the alien artifact market, both clandestine and legitimate. Then at some point they were approached by the Star Gods themselves, who offered them a deal: Osiron will stop trading psi tech, and the Star Gods will express gratitude with a steady supply of their devices. Moreover, Osiron would hold the exclusive right to develop psionic abilities, as well as manage wild psions by training or eliminating them. Osiron agreed and the Psi Academy was opened.{NEWLINE}Eventually, Osiron was investing more and more in the Psi Academy, which in turn gained so much power that it gradually overgrew Osiron. The Academy by this point was ruled by an order of female Espers who spoke for themselves, and for Osiron too, who survived as their subordinate order."
  STR_HISTORY_011_UFOPEDIA: "United Aerospace Corporation was the sole competition to the earliest form of the Guild in the space race of the XXIst century. While the Guild was formed under the auspices of the Star Gods, the UAC was mostly local Earth initiative, an alliance of private and national corporations. Unlike the Guild, who were interested mostly in prospective Hellerium mining and happy to use the Stellar Empire's solutions, the UAC was actively developing new technologies. It was finally disgraced and closed down in the early 2090s after a long decline and a series of incidents involving inter-dimensional travel, the most known one in the Iron Tribe area. The UAC was the swan song of the Old Earth civilization, and only after its fall the current sad state of affairs began in the earnest."

  STR_GNOME_TOME_3: "Gnome Tome #3"
  STR_GNOME_TOME_3_UFOPEDIA: "This thick tome tells about a type of gnome, who is living alone in a garden, tending to the plants. She learned how to talk to the flowers, and from them, she heard a lot of naughty stories from around the world. She shares these stories with the reader, always featuring herself as a recurring character. Passed along are her own, not very profound, meditations about the meaning of these stories. We also learn how she likes watching clouds, laying on fresh grass and bathing in ponds, and how a thunderstorm gives her chills."
  STR_GNOME_TOME_5: "Gnome Tome #5"
  STR_GNOME_TOME_5_UFOPEDIA: "This work of fiction tells about a type of gnome, who travels around the world, looking for some very rare book. She's a complete bookworm: you can talk her into practically anything if any books are involved. Because of that, she naturally gets 'somehow' laid a lot with bookish-type men, especially those who can also sport handsome faces and fabulous muscles. The gnome scholar is tireless in her chase for this legendary book, though, and never stays long in one place. She doesn't find it before the story ends."

  STR_GNOME_TOME_6_UFOPEDIA: "This raunchy book describes a type of gnome, who is deeply in love. The object of her adoration however remains mostly indifferent, mainly due to her total lack of social skills (she's otherwise highly intelligent). Frustrated by this, she walks around gloomily, hurting people surrounding her and the man she had chosen, while getting tormented by her own secret sadistic tendencies. In the end, everyone except herself finds a partner and gets married (very raunchy details on wedding nights). Despite being well-off, she doesn't get laid at all, except with her slaves."

  STR_SCRIPTURES_001: "Teachings of Wise Wu"
  STR_SCRIPTURES_001_UFOPEDIA: "In the ages before the Rapture, men believed themselves to be the masters of the Universe. Thus they worshipped gods who catered to their hubris: gods who personally rewarded and punished them according to man-made codes of law. As such, in calamity every man stood alone, and in prosperity they fought viciously amongst themselves to receive a reward. A winner took all the acclaim, and a victim was burdened with responsibility for their own troubles.{NEWLINE}Alas, the heavens do not work that way. Men are too small and too alike for them; the gods send both curses and blessings blindly. An evil man may escape unscatched, while his deeds bring demise to his whole village; a martyr may die thanklessly, leaving others to enjoy the blessings sent by the impressed gods. Thus, there will always be villains and heroes; and no society can survive if it scorns its men of virtue. So where is the justice in this? Only the Heavens really know if and how our souls will be judged in person, but there is no doubt that humanity is being judged as a whole."

  STR_SCRIPTURES_002_UFOPEDIA: "The opponents of immortality focus on how supposedly immoral it is, and how everything is supposed to die - to make room for them, of course. First of all, there is no immortality. Something will eventually end your existence - by accident, by design or by your own hand, when you decide you want to control the moment it will happen, instead on being at the mercy of these former circumstances. Of course, a coward would never accept that truth. A coward would say that an immortal would shy away from danger. A coward would say that an immortal will be eventually left to emptiness and loneliness after untold billions of years. Who knows what will happen in billions of years? Or is it a disturbing assumption that you and you alone will get to be immortal? Be immortal for a single day first, then another, and so on. And in your greed and envy, do not deny the chance for longevity to others, who might be less scared of it than you are. Who might need more time to create something new. Who do not blindly focus on replacing their seniors in any of the, ultimately laughable, play-pretend hierarchies."

  STR_23_UFOPEDIA: "This number puts together two irreconcillable philosophies: Duality and Trinity. This is the basic conflict between Shadowmasters and Star Gods. Summed up as 5, it represents Totality.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Trinity represents hierarchical universe, a triangle with a fatherly or motherly figure placed at the top, with the power to say what is good and what is evil. The apex is irreplaceable: Satan gets cast off the Heaven and replaced with Prophet. God is the Ultimate Truth.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Duality represents universe of conflict, a circle with no-one placed at the top. The rights and wrongs are a matter of consensus between people, and a pair forms smallest unit. What is good to some will be always bad to some others. Universal values exist since all Life is alike, but the Ultimate Truth remains forever elusive.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}As you might have noticed, 23 is also a duality. It's thermodynamics: chaos is stronger than order due to entropy. Thus Shadomasters are laidback in their sacred disagreement. 5 is a symbol of Chaos; but also of Man, and of Magic."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_001: "Giftmasters: A Brand New Menace?"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_001_UFOPEDIA: "There is an ancient saying: beware the Greeks when they're bearing gifts. No Greeks have been observed, but, in fact, there's a strange new cult on the planet, ones that are called 'Giftmasters'. They are extremely secretive, and they randomly present citizens with gifts of very high technology, never to be seen again. These 'Giftmasters' are considered highly dangerous and are being pursued by elite detectives of the Guild, as well as the Church of Sirius, but will they be able to answer the most nagging questions - who are these 'masters' and of what? And are their gifts really gifts or something else, much more ominous? The world has to know. For now, all citizens are to refuse any technologically advanced gift from a stranger and must immediately report such incidents to the authorities."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_002: "Explosions Rock Downtown!"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_002_UFOPEDIA: "Today at 02:00 AM, the city of Terminus was shaken by a violent explosion which created a 25 m wide crater and destroyed windows in a radius of almost 1 km. This is how the city celebrated the final day of this year's Death Race, the most popular sport in Death Realms! Thousands of people danced in the streets among the charred wrecks of most of these year's participants, many of them from abroad, who wanted to make their dream of just being here, now, to come true. Guild's Passenger Lines flights from Doom Harbor to Terminus are comfy, affordable, and will get you there on time. Never again wish you were somewhere else, just get your ticket now! (All travel requirements apply. Remember to check with your local Guildpost to get your travel permit.)"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_003: "Weird Goat Worshipped By Heretics"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_003_UFOPEDIA: "The Academy reports of a strange finding in the region of Dallas, D.C.: a goat with three pairs of horns. This otherwise unremarkable, black animal has already gained a considerable local fame under the name of 'Baddie'. However, although the town's general store noticed a sharp increase in tourism income, the community might be looking at some serious trouble: several bands of Dark Ones were reported near the area. As we were told by our expert Inquisitor Kashub from the Church, these maniacal heretics are most likely converging on the goat in some twisted parody of a religious pilgrimage or coronation. The locals are advised not to leave their homes for the time being, and immediately report any unexplainable observations to the special Academy hotline: 111-GOD."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_004: "Concerns About Chryssalid Gas"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_004_UFOPEDIA: "The latest Chryssalid infestation in the Southern Alpines is mostly gone after two weeks of bombardment by Blackmarch's zeppelins and artillery. Thousands of tons of Chryssalid Gas were used; this horrible weapon works by quickening the already overcharged metabolism of these creatures, making them to literally go up in flames or even explode. Officially, the gas is of little danger to normal life, but the Academy disagrees, saying that overdosage can cause mass extinctions of small creatures, thus imbalancing the biosphere, and even, rarely, ignite poorly-shielded Hellerium equipment. Provost Zakharina herself appealed to the international community to condemn Blackmarch military for their overtly brutal actions."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_005: "Rat People - Are They Real?"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_005_UFOPEDIA: "Rumors of spotting the legendary Rat People surfaced once again, this time in Central Province. Not to be confused with Ratmen, the Rat People are supposed to be actual Beastmen, but as of yet, no conclusive proof of their existence has been found; Explorers who travelled through old caves supposedly housing these strange creatures either returned with nothing, or were later found as melted remains. However, these deaths are hardly a proof of the existence of Rat People - how would such savage and uncivilized Beastmen have an access to high-energy weaponry, or the mental capacity to use it?"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_006: "Reapers Attack Again"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_006_UFOPEDIA: "Last week, thousands of mutants from Blackmarch, Romanica and the Eurasian Autonomy travelled to the hamlet of Minsk to observe the annual celebrations of their Festival of the Wagon Tongue. Indeed, many wagons do travel there, filled with mutant troublemakers, fortune-tellers and assorted thieves and brutes. The Academy again suggests a ban on Reaper Chariots in particular, as they're inherently unsafe to both riders and bystanders. The number of victims of this year's celebrations is yet unknown, but likely to reach over a dozen."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_007: "Canadian Royal Family Decimated!"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_007_UFOPEDIA: "Last evening, a thunderous explosion tore through the Canadian Royal Palace, just as the whole royal family was celebrating the 96th birthday of the retired King, Vaclav the Foreigner. The whole Western wing of the palace was levelled, killing many serfs and nobles alike, amongst them almost the whole royal family, including the old King. Queen Aurora the 2nd, who miraculously survived only with minor injuries, immediately ordered martial law, and our sources say that Canadian military forces are preparing to close the southern border. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police disclosed that the likely cause of the explosion was a plasma bomb, but flatly refused the Traders Guild's generous offer of assistance in catching the yet-unknown perpetrators."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_008: "Cloaking Devices Do Not Exist"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_008_UFOPEDIA: "Yesterday's hearing before the Council of Earth concluded the three-year long investigation into the rumored existence of the so-called Cloaking Devices, supposedly able to make ships vanish into thin air. The results, presented by the lead investigator, Colonel Clemborg, are conclusive. No such device, or any solid proof of their existence, has been found. Moreover, their supposed workings are scientifically impossible, which was confirmed by three independent teams of researchers. Even Star God magic is only known to conceal individuals, not whole ships. Naturally, some questions still remain. How did such superstition gain so much traction amongst the population? Was it a conspiracy theory? Or just a conspiracy, aimed at causing unrest and doubt? The Council concluded that people who spread such destructive rumors should be arrested. It's time to put this strange superstition to rest. No invisible predators, inter-dimensional beings or super-pirates lurk in the sky, ready to strike unwary victims."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_009: "The Forest of Steel Marches On"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_009_UFOPEDIA: "The Academy grows concerned over the recent metallization of large swathes of forest on the northern hemisphere. This rare condition, caused by fusion-powered microorganisms, quickly turns all foliage to metal alloy.{NEWLINE}'It's a sight to behold', says Lab Technician Rhonda Vallis from The Academy. 'A coniferous forest rendered in steel, including the trees, the grass, even mistletoe. Although the trees are no longer able to photosynthesize, they still grow thanks to the enormous energy stored in their cells.'{NEWLINE}Unfortunately, beautiful as they may be, these 'steel forests' carry large amounts of energy and may explode violently when damaged. Forest fires are particularly dangerous, as they easily make trees go critical and detonate, spreading the damage further.{NEWLINE}All citizens are strongly discouraged from approaching such areas. Let the professionals deal with it!"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_010: "Food Pirates Strike Again"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_010_UFOPEDIA: "Today at 06:50 local time, a Guild train carrying soy was deliberately derailed in Dark Dominion, with no casualties.{NEWLINE}The terrorist attack is believed to be linked to the recent introduction of Zero Tolerance policy by the government in Hope, in accord with the Traders Guild, against so-called 'food pirates' - farmers who use unauthorised seeds to plant their crops. Such illegal seeds are sought after due to their low price, but the lack of proper screening against genetic anomalies and possible contamination pose a great risk to all consumers. The Guild appeals to the citizens for listening to reason and buying authorised, good seeds instead of risking their lives over a few credits.{NEWLINE}The perpetrators of the train attack are still on the run."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_011: "Metal Will Miss The Finals"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_011_UFOPEDIA: "To the horror of all fans, Michael 'Metal Mike' Grendahl, 22, from Iron Tribe's national Gravball representation, Meteor Kings, was seriously injured during training. While his long-term health is not in danger, multiple limb injuries and a torn lung prevent him from participating in the finals.{NEWLINE}Metal Mike, captain of the team, is universally beloved for his finishing move 'Iron Bear Hook', developed to score both a point and a K.O. with one strike. Now the crowd seems rather desperate with him not going to the finals, where his talents would be invaluable when facing Blackmarch.{NEWLINE}'Bollocks', says his Coach Siffredi, 41. 'The boy needed a break anyway. All of it, went to his head. It would never happen in my Romanica', he explained. Even so, it's a tough year for the Iron Tribe's team: first their captain is Taken by the Star Gods, then his replacement gets himself mangled. Will they be able to defend their championship? Even if not, we do expect they'll make it to the finals, for another battle with their arch-nemesis, Blackmarch's Black Sabers."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_012: "Inquisitor Kashub: Good or Bad Cop?"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_012_UFOPEDIA: "Well, torture is a complex art, but the basics I learned on my first year, are really quite easy. Your worst enemy is defiance. Don't do anything to bolster that emotion, like by making the client hate you. You need to intimidate them instead. Everyone has some secret fantasy of domination. Some want pleasure, some want direction, some want understanding. But first, you have to shake the client up. A few methods exist, choose one you feel most fitting the client - one is by cold water, other by stripping and restraining, another is plain old beating up. Then you start applying verbal and physical stimuli, like poking them with a stick, to scare and please them in turns, so they'll feel inclined to pleasing you back by answering questions. If they go into shock, some lashing will bring them back to reality. Most will eventually tell you their little secrets. Some will remain argumentative. These are beyond help and deserve punishment like they were real criminals. Yes, simpletons say brute force always works best, but the Inquisition cannot go around murdering innocent witnesses, that'd make people less helpful to us."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_013: "The Attack Of Violent Flare Females"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_013_UFOPEDIA: "'It was horrible', says Moore Moorman, an eyewitness to the carnage. 'They were shooting people left and right, setting everything on fire, howling like wild beasts, there must have been no more than a dozen of them but it seemed like a hundred. Big, burly females armed to the teeth. But what really scared me out of my mind was the flares. It was incomprehensible - amid the whole chaos, they were throwing flares; at corpses, at each other, everywhere, as if they were having fun. This wasn't natural, I tell you.'{NEWLINE}This recent attack is just another one of a string of violent robberies and kidnappings committed by this new, strange gang. There is still no confirmation on who they might be, but their apparent (and quite impossible) global reach, coupled with the extreme danger they pose, suggest conspiracy, false flag, or other distraction. The flares must be just a part of this psy op, serving no other purpose than to advertise it and spread confusion. The only question is, what major power stands behind this diabolical deception?"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_014: "Special Interview: Inquisitor Kashub"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_014_UFOPEDIA: "It is a rare occasion when we can have the pleasure of talking to a celebrity as distinguished as Dr. Kashub, an Inquisitor of the Church. Our guest entertained us with stories of his youth as a Spartan kid and how he had seen the light after a theological dispute with his superior (who lost the dispute, among other things). As a member of the Church special forces, Dr. Kashub has seen countless horrors and learned about the human heart, which allowed him to  eventually assume the inquisitorial mantle and continue his effort of 'purging the unwashed' from the face of our planet. When asked how he manages to stay sane despite witnessing such terrible things, he stated that 'It's much easier when you see the world through rosy glasses', while putting his trademark pink vision aids on."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_015: "Biocock Insanity"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_015_UFOPEDIA: "There's a new deadly weapon on the market and it has the most unexpected form: a rooster. These 'biococks' are fully robotic under their living tissue and they are programmed to kill for their masters. There are already several reports of marauding bands of Ratmen using herds of these cybernetic weapons to attack towns.{NEWLINE}'It is unclear who is behind these mechanical nightmares', explains detective Fong. 'But we have some solid leads and will capture the perpetrators shortly. After all these machines are not only deadly, but also deemed forbidden by Star Gods!'{NEWLINE}Good luck, detective! But whoever it is, we know they are completely insane."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_016: "The Rejuvenation Ceremony"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_016_UFOPEDIA: "Like this time every year, the streets of Jerusalem have filled with pilgrims, coming from all parts of the world to participate in this holiest of Church's celebrations. The most striking is the contrast between that colorful throng and the stern faces of Theban female soldier-clones, who have been securing the premises since Jerusalem fell into the Theban fold a few years ago.{NEWLINE}'There's no enmity at all', exclaims Celebras Primas John Wando. 'All living creatures are children of the Stars and everyone can see the light! The path to enlightenment is open to all, from the lowliest to the finest, as long as they, whatever their daily toils might be, follow the path of self-improvement. It is through the natural path that we rise from the mud of our creation towards the light of the stars, in this life and all the others. Blessed be the Star Gods, who, being so enlightened themselves, choose to help our lowly planet to follow the path of glory, instead of drowning in pain, sickness and confusion like many civilizations that had fallen before. Anyone is welcome to celebrate with us!"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_017: "Replicator Outbreak in Siberia"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_017_UFOPEDIA: "A local warlord, Armok, also known as 'God of Blood', caused quite a stir on the Eurasian Autonomy's border when he crossed into the country with what turned out to be remains of his followers, turned into self-replicating weapons, and proceeded to attack townships, thus swelling the ranks of his 'army'. The authorities were slow to act, since the last known outbreak of the Necron_Vampire 1.0 Replicator happened over 200 years ago, which for many is little more than an age of myths, it seems. Thankfully, local militia from the Witchaven area put an end to the situation before it could claim more lives. As the replicating swarm (with Armok in the centre of it) advanced across the countryside, it was easy to spot, so they napalm-bombed it from the air, using their archaic jetfighters. As Aviation Colonel Zhabov, who was the commander of the operation, put it, 'thankfully these self-replicators don't have the capability to reach too many z-levels up'."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_018: "Phobos Hits the Charts"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_018_UFOPEDIA: "The Cybermites are already a legend on the robe rock scene, and the spectacular success of its new album 'Dark Side of Phobos' may well skyrocket them even higher! The album is a modern retelling of the classic tale of Knights of Cydonia, ancient Earthlings who were the first to answer the Star Gods call and pledged loyalty to them on Mars, where they went in a makeshift vessel. As the group's frontman explained, it provides the most enticing story to tell, with all its action, conflict, spirituality and rich characters, and therefore made perfect material for music.{NEWLINE}'It was a very hard task', he said, 'but I think we nailed it. We've never learned so much before, but it was also great fun.'{NEWLINE}If you haven't been to their concert yet, or you want to repeat the experience, then watch out for The Cybermites' world tour that starts next month! And now there is also talk about a new Cydonia movie, so... stay entertained!"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_019: "Rogue Leaflets Attack Steel Pact"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_019_UFOPEDIA: "The streets of Memory of Earth are terrified of the recent propaganda attacks, where an as-yet-unidentified terrorist group struck the very heart of the city. The attack was executed with hundreds of thousands of adhesive posters with only two words on them, 'ZANDER LIVES', and a mysterious symbol. The posters turned out to be much more than paper and glue: they fed on organic waste, which is ubiquitous in the area, then multiplied and went looking for any vertical flat surface to stick onto, obviously causing panic along the way. Fortunately they were mostly harmless to humans, except for several distressed individuals who had to have their hair cut to free them from the demonic posters.{NEWLINE}The local government is unable to tell at this point if this attack was politically motivated or some other sort of crime. In any case, if you hear about a person named Zander, or know anything about the attack, please report to the nearest Marsec office to collect a reward of up to $5,000."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_020: "Pectoids: Threat or Hoax?"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_020_UFOPEDIA: "Horror and panic have gripped the borough of Edinburg, Iron Tribe. The locals are reluctant to leave their homes after dark for fear of so-called 'Pectoids', animalistic creatures resembling Reticulans but possessed of great physical agility and aggression. As the locals have it, they glow in the dark with unholy light and leap to claw and bite their victims to slake their thirst of blood. The Academy has already issued a statement, informing that Pectoid sightings have been reported in various places for decades, and an investigation of every house in Edinburg would be a good idea. The Iron Tribe government, however, stubbornly refuses to give permission to do so. The Courier was able to interrogate a Reticulan who was recently arrested in Edinburg for Immoral Behaviour. 'Man, there are no Pectoids' said Mr. Dunk. 'We were simply so high on Atom Beer that we were glowing. We were even unable to walk upright, much less harm anybody.'"

  STR_NEWSPAPER_022: "Evil of the Wastes"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_022_UFOPEDIA: "To normal citizens, little is known about the endless Wasteland that begins just beyond the borders of civilized society. To many, this sparsely populated expanse is synonymous with romantic ideals of freedom and unbounded imagination. Reasonable people know it to be largely untrue, and the Wasteland is rife with danger and contain little of interest, no more than your familiar city-border shantytown can offer. And if one really wants to travel it, there are job openings in the Guild, Academy and other organizations, allowing you to fulfill your dreams while doing constructive work.{NEWLINE}However not many know or believe in the great evils that plague the most dangerous parts of the Wasteland: the notorious Narlock and Lokk'Naar tribes, the worst barbarians of all, grown rich on crime, and indulging in every villainy imaginable, like cannibalism, ritual child rape, human sacrifice and torture. These traits are shared by various mercenaries they employ, chief amongst them the little-known and horrendously mutated Ubers, through whose veins runs insanity, making them completely devoid of morality or respect for life."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_023: "Xenophobia and Xenophilia"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_023_UFOPEDIA: "It has been many centuries since the Earth became a part of Galactic civilization, yet our attitude towards it, sadly, remains largely cave-age. 'We should not be afraid of aliens,' says Inquisitor Kashub. 'Fear breeds hatred, so does ignorance. Aliens can be strange, disgusting, even despicable to our narrow minds, but in most cases this is just a question of the lack of tolerance and understanding. The one most despicable thing in the universe is xenophobia, and very few spacefaring civilizations are inflicted with this disease, since if they did, they likely would have long ago destroyed themselves in warfare. Let's not become known as a rare black sheep in this big family of life. Remember, just like we struggle to understand aliens, so they struggle to understand us, let's not assume the lack of goodwill on their part, or, even worse, our own superiority. Fearless souls, blessed with Xenophiliac fervour will pave us a way to taking part in this galaxy of wonder, peace and beauty'."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_024: "It's all Males' Fault, Says The Academy"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_024_UFOPEDIA: "'The question we're asked the most often,' said Provost Zakharina in the inauguration speech of the annual Grand Academy Conference in the Black Citadel, 'Is why only females are accepted into the ranks of our respectable institution? Such a question might sound benign, but nothing can be more deceiving! Before our Academy was established, science had been in the hands of males for countless centuries. After overthrowing the original Matriarchate, power-hungry and sexually-frustrated males kept devising horrors of war and soulless, environment-polluting machines, culminating in the unforgivable Uranus Bomb. We won't allow them to inflict pain on humanity ever again!'{NEWLINE}Standing ovations lasted for almost an hour, until the moderator motioned the delegates to sit down."
  STR_NEWSPAPER_025: "The Church is United As Ever"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_025_UFOPEDIA: "It was a glorious day in Jerusalem as the first annual Unity Tour kicked off, bringing together all members of the Church in blessed communion. Though packed with luminaries from around the world, most notable of all was His Holiness Pope Pelagius VI and none other than one of the Star Gods here to sanctify these grand festivities with His presence. 'It is a supreme honour to address you today on behalf of the Elder Ones.' proclaimed His Holiness to bottomless applause, 'As children of the stars, whether pureblood, mutant or xeno, we all come together as one family united and directed by their most benevolent guidance. When we act in solidarity nothing can stand between or against us. Blessed are the works of the Masters! Eternal is their rule!' Inspiring words, and certainly more than enough to win over even the most foul heretics falsely alleging this to be a desperate act of reconciliation between so-called 'feuding splinters' within the Church. How blasphemously absurd!"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_026: "Inquisitor Kashub rocks Academy's boat"
  STR_NEWSPAPER_026_UFOPEDIA: "The most recent effort of the Academy to improve the moral and physical health of the mutant population has taken a wholly unexpected turn. Yesterday, at the harbour of Ventura (Cali Republic) the Academy medical staff has boarded and detained a vessel belonging to an individual calling himself Captain Amuys, on the suspicion of smuggling dangerous materials. And for a good reason, as it was discovered, his ship arriving from Fuso was loaded not only with exotic Eastern weaponry, but also with illustrated literature of questionable artistic virtues. In their holy anger, the Academy staff set out to burn the books in question, only to be surprised by the sudden arrival of none other than Inquisitor Kashub, who explained that the seized goods were, in fact, brought to be donated to one of Church's museums - which the unlucky sea merchant eagerly confirmed. Later that day, nine Academy Nurses were admitted to a local hospital after reportedly being attacked by a shark while skinny-dipping. However, the Academy denied any relation between these two incidents."

  STR_NEWSPAPER_028_UFOPEDIA: "The heated case of a Canadian Govt Ordinator being shot down by a MERC gunship was today resolved before the Guild's Aerospace Court. As a reminder, the famous MERC Captain, Jonesy 'JJ' James, who was in command of the gunship, has pleaded not guilty, claiming he took the Ordinator for a smuggler ship. This later came under criticism, when an investigation team led by special envoy Col. Clemborg found no evidence of restricted goods in the wreckage. All hung in the balance untily JJ's final speech, in which he highlighted: 'This is not about if there was any contraband smuggled or not. If the govts were more efficient, the populace wouldn't be so morally lacking as to desire such goods.' After a long session, the court ruled the incident as an unfortunate mistake and cleared JJ of all the charges.{NEWLINE}After the verdict, JJ told our reporter that he's heading to a Church's resort to celebrate.

  STR_LOKNAR_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "The two tribes, who seem to feud about everything, do agree about their shared origins. The first mutants were either created by space plagues that swept away the Old Earth, or were lifted into the skies by the Star Gods directly to be altered and returned to Earth. Narlocks and Lokk'Naars came into being at roughly the same time, but quite differently. Legend has it they were taken deep underground, and mutated by the Dragons. The mythical reptiles bestowed upon them their wisdom and tenacity, then deserted their creation in favor of other, unfathomable pursuits. Since then, both peoples came to develop their own identities, neither reptillian nor human, Lokk'Naars embracing the curse of Darkness (also called Lokk'Naar), while Narlocks striving to ascend into the Light."

The Sun and the Moon, two opposites who form a whole; bedfellows who never mix. It's not simply good and evil; like Yin-Yang symbol, they form a fractal. Each step into this fractal reveals light aspects within dark, and vice versa. They represent universal duality; the thesis and antithesis, leading to synthesis. Scholars of this religion hold the concept of neutrality heretical: spineless rationalism, neither material nor spiritual, welcoming the dread Star-Spirits of Death & denying violence that is Life."

  STR_GODS_G8_UFOPEDIA: "The Heavenly Guide, the Teacher, one of the 8 Celestial Spirits of the Narlock Pantheon. He brings enlightenment to all, and his Charity is beyond measure. His vices are excess of expectations, and the desire to see and understand everything, whatever the price."

  STR_GODS_E8: "Lady of Nine Moons"
  STR_GODS_E1_UFOPEDIA: "The God of Power, the chief deity of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar Pantheon of Violence. His aspects are Pride, Pleasure and Swag. He is the ruler of the Demonic Kingdom, who presides from his golden palace. Everything he possesses, from material wealth to slaves, is of the very best quality. He is devilishly cunning and skilled, as befits the Emperor. He spares no expense on his property and weighs his decisions carefully. This brings him adulation of his worshippers, who are proud to have such a diligent tyrant."
  STR_GODS_E2_UFOPEDIA: "The Goddess of Love and Alchemy, one of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon. Her aspects are Gluttony and Timidity. She gives everything and demands everything. She considers herself pure, brave, humble, honest, diligent and generous, which she sees as Virtues that make a Soul. As the Demonic Cook she says that you will be consumed; a virtuous Soul will humbly accept such devouring, and be reborn; an empty Soul, devoid of Love, will be digested. She wants her worshippers to consume her, as well."
  STR_GODS_E3_UFOPEDIA: "The God of Death and Carnival, the God of Trickery and Truth, one of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon. Life is Carnival, Death is a Joke. He idly observes the world and favors those who don't lose hope, led astray by immaterial illusions. Nothing amuses him as much as death caused by Hubris, and, being a mischievous god, he enjoys fuelling people's delusions of grandeur, so that the Universe, which is the Endless Graveyard, will cut them down. Despite his seemingly carefree nature, he is the patron of such places as cemeteries, libraries and archives."
  STR_GODS_E4_UFOPEDIA: "One of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon. Known also as The Grand General of Chernobog. The Goddess of Envy, Avarice and Justice. She cuts down those who grow too tall. She shackles those who grow too free. She is the Dragon Guardian of the great treasury of the Demonic Kingdom - a treasury that is also armory, library, foodstore and prison. She is the Black Knight, and she protects the order in the Demonic Kingdom and collects taxes. Ruthless, violent, greedy, but honorable, she is the Judge, Jury and Executioner who beheads the condemned. As a deity linked to cats, she holds particular contempt for those possessed by the spirits of mice."
  STR_GODS_E5_UFOPEDIA: "One of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon, God of Fire. He's a force of ruin and purification both. He can give strength and immaculacy to the faithful, but brings ruin to those who invoke his name light-heartedly. He brings despair to those who believe in Flesh, and strength to those who follow the Machine. He is the iron law of the universe that destroys delusions, the might that can accomplish any victory if wielded right. He's worshipped in the Lokk'Naar Festival of Fire; any explosion is like a prayer to him."
  STR_GODS_E6_UFOPEDIA: "The Goddess of Lust and Unity, one of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon. She is the Demonic Assassin, patron of cute creatures like snakes, spiders and scorpions; of assassins and watchmen. She has powers of control over water, blood and emotions. Man is a hunter, and hunter lives and dies by the hunt (literally or otherwise). The means are irrelevant; what counts is spiritual devotion and the final result. You can assassinate by dagger, by deceit, by charm, by science or even by an army, it doesn't matter how. Assassination is how weak triumphs over the strong. Clever, patient, aggressive, and completely insane, she commands the Legions of the Damned."
  STR_GODS_E7_UFOPEDIA: "The God of Madness and Confusion, one of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon. He is the one who caused the Original Sin and Lokk'Naar flight from the paradise. He brings madness upon those who walk any path purposefully and single-mindedly, while closing their eyes to other possibilities. He brings fortune and knowledge to the seekers, but he is as likely to take it away from those who have grown complacent. He is the eternal wanderer of the endless and shifting paths of the Demonic Kingdom."
  STR_GODS_E8_UFOPEDIA: "The Goddess of Darkness and Secrets, worshipped greedily by dreamers, magicians and merchants, one of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon. She is the ever-elusive Enigma, the Arcane that cannot be comprehended by the Mundane. Those who worship her wish to explore and uncover the deepest Darkness she wreaths herself in, tantalizing just beyond the touch, tempting with the infinite Unknown. She brings confusion upon those who want simple and honest answers. Her commandments are: to Know, to Want, to Dare, to Keep Silent. She is loved for her occasional unwarranted generousness in wisdom. Her totem animals are bats, owls, moths, and the bogeymen."
  STR_ERIS: "Eris"
  STR_ERIS_UFOPEDIA: "They say she is the Goddess of Discord, but her true nature is much more than that. Disciples of Deios, her male counterpart, called her Lilith, the whore to Satan. Before that she was known as Tiamat, mother of demons. And indeed, both the Demon Gods and Celestial Spirits are her children. She is the original God, the God of Chaos, from which everything else was birthed, including Deios and his Trinity. He is the creator of all Things, but Connections, which are of Eris, of Chaos, are older than Things. And the existence of Connections makes establishing any final order impossible. Eris embodies Duality, and seems to be worshipped by the Shadowmasters. This concept might let us understand their works more."

There is nothing wrong in being drunk with power. Nothing can spoil your feast, but yourself - by being picky, petty and avaricious. Only those who disdain will be disdained. Only those who become tasty will find the real fulfillment."
  STR_SCROLL_E4_UFOPEDIA: "Honor implies duty. Duty implies rules. Rules imply punishment. Punishment implies blood. Blood implies life. Life implies soul.

  STR_SCROLL_E5_UFOPEDIA: "Fire destroys, but fire also cleanses. Purify your land, your house, your body, your soul of all that is your enemy; only then you will gain true strength. Do not fear pain, but that what is your foe. Sometimes fear is a good advisor. Have fear in your heart. Respect fire, for if wielded by a weak hand, it will bring you ruin. But when wielded with might, it will make you prosper."
  STR_SCROLL_E8_UFOPEDIA: "The Night is dark, endless and full of possibilities. But only those with a passionate and sharp mind can find them. There is power beyond compare in knowing secrets no one else does. Yours will be the keen sight to pierce the obscurity, and a cover of enigma to hide your movements.

  STR_MYTH_001: "Myths: The Second Snake"
  STR_MYTH_001_UFOPEDIA: "One day, the Sun Conqueror decided to invade the land of the Snake Queen. Always hungry for battle, he had no fear of the Demon Goddess, as conquest was his birthright, received from the Sun. The Queen sent forth Naga, one of her two great snakes. A fierce battle ensued, but the snake was no match for the Conqueror's might. But - what of the second snake? He proceeded cautiously, wary to protect his back; and in the meantime, Naga regenerated her wounds and he had to fight her again. This repeated many times, and the Conqueror felt tired, while gaining no ground. So he decided to risk everything on a bold move. He invoked every ounce of the Solar power left in him, and became a bolt of dazzling energy, which pierced through Naga and the walls of the Queen's fortress. He was weary, but now he had the Queen within his arm's reach. 'Before I strike you down,' he said, 'Tell me: where were you hiding your second snake?'. The Queen smiled, like a predator who has cornered her prey. 'The second snake... Is me.'"
  STR_MYTH_002: "Myths: The Paper Man"
  STR_MYTH_002_UFOPEDIA: "One day, a thin, dark skinned young man with a skull-topped cane knocked on the gates of the Boogle Library. 'I have an appointment with Dr. Minsky,' he said to a bald scholar who opened the door. The scholar, while surprised, said: 'Come in quickly, you will be delighted to see the Doctor as he is now. It is our, and his, greatest success!' As they entered, a strange man approached. He seemed to be made entirely of paper; countless white pages, covered with impossibly fine print. 'Here he is, made Immortal! Everything he is, moved to these pages, none of his thoughts to be ever forgotten, his great mind working more clearly than ever before.' The young man raised his brow: 'But that is not Dr. Minsky. Dr. Minsky is there-' he motioned with his cane towards a formerly empty chair, where now a rotting human corpse was sitting. 'I found him where you buried him,' he said to the horrified scholars. 'But was he completely dead when you did so?' He motioned again and the corpse rose, hands curling into claws with clearly murderous intent. 'I'll leave you, gentlemen, to yourselves now'. The young man was smiling when he heard the first screams."
  STR_MYTH_003: "Myths: The Love Garden"
  STR_MYTH_003_UFOPEDIA: "The Journeyman Wizard was approaching a lush garden. Some bizarre garden it was; with white tree bark, and leaves of rich purple. A voluptuous woman of plain, yet comely features was tending to a bed of flowers. Her skin was pale like the bark, and her hair and eyes were purple like the flowers. 'How comes,' asked the Journeyman, 'That plants bearing such sickly colors, can look so strong and healthy?'. The woman smiled. 'It is because of Love. It makes it possible to accept such Paradox. Poison and medicine, ugliness and beauty...' She looked him in the eye. 'Will you stay at my garden, Good Master?' 'What makes you think I am good?' retorted the young Wizard in a sly manner. The woman pushed aside some flowers, showing the blossoms were growing on a pile of human bones. She smiled again, showing sharp teeth. 'There is something good in everyone.' The Journeyman bowed, tipping his hat. 'You will find there is much more than that to me, Fair Lady.'"
  STR_MYTH_004: "Myths: The Lady and the Thief"
  STR_MYTH_004_UFOPEDIA: "One night, the Lady of Nine Moons descended to the mortal realm to participate in one of her secret rituals. Seeing her figure, cloaked in a long, hooded robe, a coven of her priestesses immediately prostrated themselves. As it is customary in the prayers to the Night Lady, they covered their eyes with the backs of their hands, and pressed their palms firmly to the ground. And then, the Lady started to dance; first, she lowered the hood, then she shed her robe altogether. They all knew the seductive goddess was dancing amongst them in the nude, but they were forbidden to look; so close, so tempting, but just beyond grasp, as she always is. The only one who watched her was a young thief who came here for a different kind of treasure. When the Lady was taken up in her elation, the thief jumped out of the trees and stole her robe. The Goddess was struck dumb in the face of such crude audacity, and just stood there, unable to act, letting the thief escape. They say that the other Gods still laugh at the Lady to this day; yet no curse has befallen the thief."
  STR_MYTH_005: "Myths: The Death Bride"
  STR_MYTH_005_UFOPEDIA: "This particular corpse should have been just like countless others. A corpse of a young maiden who cut her wrists in the bath for some silly mortal reason. Yet Skullface was moved. The pointlessness of it all, the fragile beauty ruined all too soon. He felt pity overwhelming him against all reason, and so, he took the corpse to his adobe and breathed the soul back into it. It was a joyous moment; but as the days and months flew, he realized the maiden doesn't want to leave. She apparently fell in love with her saviour. 'I reversed time for you, but you want to stop it altogether. It is forbidden. You must move on.'. To which she insisted she wants to stay with him forever. 'So be it,' he sighed, and turned her lifeless once again. As he was adding the beautiful corpse to his growing gallery, he thought to himself, 'And so again, I hoped this time it will be different. Will the wisest of the gods ever learn?'"
  STR_MYTH_006: "Myths: Blazko the Warrior"
  STR_MYTH_006_UFOPEDIA: "The Tower of Fire held an immense treasure which every adventurer coveted. Many perished in the effort. But one day Blazko, the hero of the spinning kick, arrived at the tower.{NEWLINE}After fighting some lesser monsters, he came eye to eye with Moloch, a demon of iron. Moloch used his hot steam breath, but Blazko spun a whirlwind with his flying kicks and repelled the attacks, then gradually tore the beast to mechanical pieces.{NEWLINE}As he climbed the tower, he was approached by Shinya, who commanded skeletal cats. The cats rattled their bones and rushed Blazko. Blazko took down his shirt and kicked it furiously until it resembled a ball of yarn, thus distracting the undead animals enough to vanquish their mistress.{NEWLINE}Finally, in the treasure room awaited Dark Knight, whose gaze carried supernatural fear. Blazko quickly felt the strength leaving him. But he did not give up; instead he emptied his mind and entered a trance of death, where fear is irrelevant. He vanquished the Knight, but their fierce battle left the tower in ruins, its treasure lost. Then The Destroyer himself appeared before him and said: 'You did not come here for the treasure. Welcome back, my son.'"
  STR_MYTH_007: "Myths: The Price Of Freedom"
  STR_MYTH_007_UFOPEDIA: "The slaves toiled day after day, flogged and opressed by an unforgiving Tyrant. There was no hope in their life, no joy, no respite, only endless labour for the glory of Tyrant's city. One day, a young slave called out to the Gods to deliver him from this calamity. The call was so desperate it was heard by The Liberator himself, and the god appeared before the slave. 'Why are you crying?' he asked. 'Here, your chains are broken now. Stand up and fight!' 'But the guards will kill us!' protested the slave. 'You are dead men anyway' was the answer. And so, the slaves have risen up against the Tyrant, and, while many died, they managed to win. They burned the city to the ground, then began a new life as free men. But it wasn't an easy life, as the Wasteland is unforgiving. The former slave, now a warrior and leader, called out to Liberator once more. 'Lord, while we're free now, we toil even harder and suffer great hardships. The Tyrant at least was feeding us, but now we starve and die! Why it must be so?'. 'Freedom is never for free,' answered the god, 'And it will give you nothing but what you can seize by yourself.'"

  STR_MYTH_100_UFOPEDIA: "When the first man was still walking the Earth, one night he met a cat. As he marvelled at the strange creature, the cat spoke:{NEWLINE}'The cat has a deal for you, human.

In exchange, you will build an interstellar cruiser for us.'{NEWLINE}'But, what for?' asked the man.{NEWLINE}'The cat sees these blinking lights in the dark sky, and desires to put its paw on them all. Besides, this planet will end someday, and the glory of cat race cannot ever end. But look at cat's paws. The cat cannot do it alone. The cat needs your hands.'{NEWLINE}The man pondered on the strange words, then finally said: 'Alright, cat. Do something about these sabretooth tigers, and you've got yourself a deal'.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Now look around, young reader. Do you see any sabretooth tigers?"

  STR_VIP_001_UFOPEDIA: "The mysterious hero and champion of the Narlocks. She supposedly established Jillsville to gather all the remaining free people in the world. It happened decades ago, yet the legend has it that she's not a normal person, but a revenant, unjustly murdered and risen from her grave to be the defender of all who are treaded upon. Others say she doesn't exist at all, and her persona is assumed by various champions of justice in the form of a symbol. This could explain how she survived all her battles, many of which were lost. She is the arch-enemy of Jack, leader of the Lokk'Naars."
  STR_VIP_002_UFOPEDIA: "The teenage Crown Princess of the Kingdom of Canada, aka 'Prinzesin'. Her ethereal beauty made her quite a celebrity in the media, but in reality, not that much is known of her, as she remains secluded in her castle, possibly due to mental ilness. Some blame the inbreeding within the Blackmarch-originating Canadian dynasty, others speak of dark magics involved and attribute her with demonic powers, such as multilocation."
  STR_VIP_003_UFOPEDIA: "A celebrity Inquisitor for the Church of Sirius, famous for his radical methods and rose-tinted sunglasses. A good-natured man with a great sense of humour. His skill and passion for hunting heretics are a stuff of legend.

They're a very rare breed.'"

  STR_GDX_000_UFOPEDIA: "Dr. X has been in our lives for the last 15 years or so, since we were kidnapped by the Academy as small children and brought to her research facility. Most of the Academy staff there were rather petty and shallow in anything beyond their narrow areas of expertise. They treated our upbringing like a chore and wasted no opportunity to belittle us. Dr. X however, seemed a completely different person; a very intelligent and driven one. And much more dangerous. While the Academy didn't allow us any sort of weapons, she occasionally trained us in their use. While cold and distant, she treated us to many weird, curious and scary stories. This doesn't mean she wasn't abusive nor extremely possessive; that latter characteristic suggests she won't back off now, either."
  STR_GDX_001_UFOPEDIA: "A group of six mostly harmless, but rather valuable Uber females have escaped my research establishment. They stole my Airbus #58 (my favorite one) and disappeared without a trace. Your group has been selected for the important task of finding them and bringing them back, preferably rather alive than dead. Even I usually find it difficult to revive bullet-ridden corpses. Urgency is advised, I'm getting weary of constant delays to my research. So, if you fail this mission, I'll make sure with your boss that your next job will be serving as Osiron playthings or hunting Sky Ninjas. By the way, no weapon funding was allocated by the Academy, so make do with what you can.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}XOXO{NEWLINE}  - Dr. G.X."
  STR_GDX_002_UFOPEDIA: "Your unfortunate predecessors have failed miserably in securing the valuable mutants, so I decided to entrust this task to someone of higher intelligence (hopefully). I have found out that the escapees are holed up in some cave. Find it and capture them, then bring them to any one of the R-Level 'Hospitals'. The Academy has promised me a lot, but my research is stalling for months now. Return empty-handed, and I shall have your panties on a silver platter.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}XOXO{NEWLINE}  - Dr. G.X."
  STR_GDX_003_UFOPEDIA: "To find that mysterious 'Dr. X.' who seems to be responsible for the experimental camp of our origin, we need to find the place. Which isn't that easy, since the fools whom we questioned say there are multiple such camps. We could start striking blindly, but the best chance of success would be to capture and interrogate a high-ranked member of the Academy, one of the so-called Espers.{NEWLINE}Dr. X is also rumored to be associated with the Humanists, so interrogating these might help us too, unless the rumors are false."
  STR_GDX_004_UFOPEDIA: "The Esper we interrogated was able to tell us how to find the prison/lab camps where 'Dr. X.' conducts her experiments. Apparently she was subcontracted in mysterious circumstances to do a specific task. The Esper didn't know what the task was, but it seemed to have to do with increasing brainpower and magical prowess of Ubers, something the Academy would normally never consider worthy of pursuing.{NEWLINE}There is a major problem, though - the hideouts are heavily fortified and the only way of infiltrating them would be feigning surrender and letting ourselves be locked up, before breaking the camp from inside; that way we'll only have to deal with mostly untrained and poorly armed Academicians."
  STR_GDX_005_UFOPEDIA: "It details the experiments of Dr. Gudrun X. She was apparently analyzing us, Uber gals, in great detail, in order to create some sort of superhybrids: our Hellerium-powered vitality combined with the magical potential of Reticulan Sirens, which is dormant due to the lack of energy to power it. Young Uber gals would be taken from their Zone villages for careful study, nurturing and enhancement by biotechnology. Just like it happened to us. We are an imperfect result, though, possessing only slightly improved magic and intelligence. Dr. X concludes that the Academy lacks tools and knowledge advanced enough to allow her to create these new mutants, called Hellerians - in reference to Etherians, aka the Star Gods, whom Hellerians were supposed to easily rival in magic. What's her real agenda? The Academy hoped to increase the power of Espers, but it doesn't add up, and to learn the true story, we need to have a talk with the Doctor... in person."
  STR_GDX_006_UFOPEDIA: "Real name Gudrun Dunst. She's a descendant of a proud Pureblood family, traditionally associated with the Humanists. The old photo we have obtained shows her at age 19, when she was admitted into one of the secret Humanist research facilities. Coming from the field of biology, she became involved in Humanist experiments on maximizing the magical potential of Purebloods. She left the facility several years ago due to apparent disagreement with Humanist leadership over ideological matters.{NEWLINE}Even before that happened, she has fallen into disfavor due to her 'immoral' experiments she refused to abstain from."
  STR_GDX_007_UFOPEDIA: "Search for further data on the fate of Ubers whom Dr. X is experimenting on shows that she takes some of them away to a secret location, some tropical island she refers to as 'a safe home, where nobody will disturb us'; the island is apparently a Zone, but other than that, nothing is known about it. It seems that Gudrun's obsession with us runs so deep she doesn't trust the Academy types with us more than she has to. However, she gets access to their resources due to protection of one of the highest Academy officials she is personally involved with. If we catch this person, Dr. X will lose the Academy's support. We can either work through Academy's security protocols to get into one of their Campuses where Scientists can be found, or follow the Ghoul lead to find where Counsellors are holding their secret conferences. There is no sure-fire way to get a Provost, except the biggest ships and Secret Bases."
  STR_GDX_008_UFOPEDIA: "After we've found this picture of Dr. X, partially out of her Academy Counsellor's uniform, in the possessions of our hostage, the further interrogation went smoothly. Apparently Dr. X seduced her to get into the Academy's higher echelons, and was using her to command the Academy's resources needed for hunting and researching Gals. One thing is certain, the whole Uber research is Dr. X's personal passion, not an Academy project, and now, after all the disasters we inflicted upon the Academy, and her protector ending up in our custody, she's on her own. Maybe we can use this hostage to draw her out of hiding."
  STR_GDX_009_UFOPEDIA: "Dr. X's young lover, Khyra, is feisty and temperamental. She has advanced so high in the Academy's structures due to being devilishly cunning and attractive, as well as completely shameless. Khyra was there only for the position, and never liked how the Star Gods subdued our planet. She is personally invested in Dr. X's plans to create 'Hellerians'. She also told us about Dr. X's parents; they apparently were amongst Humanist leadership and were murdered by Humanist hardliners in some power play. We can ransom Khyra to Dr. X and forget about this whole mess, or use her (research) to draw Dr. X out... but how to make sure it works?"
  STR_GDX_010_UFOPEDIA: "Well, well, look at you. You've come a long way, baby. From a curious kid, through a brave young warrior, to someone who upheaves the whole fabric of our so-called civilization. You dispatched these Academy fools so easily, and you've come to seek me out personally. You've even released Khyra. I must say, I am proud of you.

Dr. X gets deposited in a huge pot. You savor her shocked expression, and notice her clarity of mind as she doesn't try pointless protesting or bargaining, just looks at you with these big green eyes, as the water gets hotter and hotter. She is no less shocked when you cut the heat and proceed to wash her up. 'What? Did you really think I'm letting you off the hook so easily, Gudrun? Such a silly girl.

Dr. X shifts and says, 'I have created them a place... to live. A nice place. Where no one can hurt them. Do you really think you can impose this life of violence upon those inexperienced girls?'

Or maybe it is just your dark, slutty side enjoying the destruction.' The Doctor says nothing, but her gaze takes on a new level of intensity. 'Yet, again and again, you stubbornly return to upholding your illusions of purity. I want to shatter them once and for all. Will you put your life on the line for this?'

Humanism is an old term, opposed to Naturalism. Their belief is that Nature always knows best and things should be left to fend for themselves; while we see the man as a part of nature, its strong, responsible master and gardener. In the post-invasion era, the uncontrolled experiments of the Star Gods brought a dazzling variety to what once was the human race. As such, Humanism is really not about any notion of 'purity,' as professed by its radical, misguided elements. It is about retaking control over this chaos for the ultimate benefit of mankind. Else the power will belong to collectivist populists who'll manage to exploit the poverty and divisions between mutants to further their ulterior goals. The Mutant Alliance seeks no change except of who's in power. This is a state of hopeless, perpetual weakness.'"
  STR_GDX_103_UFOPEDIA: "'When I was young, I was contacted by the Thule Group over a pioneering research project. I didn't know much about them, but I was excited.

I conducted many experiments, mostly on myself. That is how I became hellerium powered, just like you are. That part wasn't the problem, though. With time I discovered that the Thule Group seeks to create human networks - where brains of the 'slaves' would be robbed of free will and subservient to the 'masters', who'll thus gain powers of unparalleled magnitude.

I insisted upon erecting at least an observation perimeter, but that only got me banned from the suit storage. I slipped out without any; I still had all sorts of equipment of my own construction. I found the zombie hive. I recorded it all, including when zombies finally advanced upon the habitat and ate everyone. They had it coming. I survived by covering myself with a fresh corpse.

When inquired, Dr. X explains that she was born as a true pureblood, but transformed herself with the power of science. Now her body is not only stronger, but also gained some qualities similar to higher Zombie forms, like Strixes, being able to produce the rejuvenating 'Zombie Juice'. As for the question why, Dr. X gets quite embarrassed before revealing she expressly wanted to be able to experience extremes and survive it. She did avoid these extremes, though; as she says, she was afraid of losing herself."
  STR_GDX_108_UFOPEDIA: "'It's more like a dream than an actual project,' explains Dr. X. 'Enhancing powerful psykers with Hellerium metabolism, a technique I used on myself, takes years. It wouldn't be possible to create an army that way. On the other hand, improving Ubers with Siren or maybe Zombie biology, that makes sense. We could make warriors to rival the Star Gods. Yet, it's likely hopeless. It would require modification of an unheard of level of complexity, and a much deeper understanding of biotechnology.'"

I theorize that it creates some sort of resonance within the Shadowtech, that slowly builds up and leads to disruption when the damage control kicks in and excess energy is released. It would be possible to adjust our devices to avoid this problem, but to that end, we'd need to know more about how exactly the Disruptor works, and that requires finding its makers."

Our investigations have only shown that whoever they are, they have easy access to Optronics. It also doesn't seem that they're any of the big Factions. Looks like we need to devise alternative ways of investigating them, and large quantities of Optronics are unlikely to be completely overlooked by the criminal underground."

No doubt the Shadowtech Disruptor we've found is both highly valuable and highly illegal, just like the Cloaking Devices. With that knowledge, we prodded our Smuggler contacts about possible sources of Shadowtech. While we didn't get names or addresses, we had more luck than with our previous investigation into that matter. It is rumored that Shadowtech originates from space, and indeed some Smugglers seem to be involved. If they trade it to Technocracy, they would be doing it in one of the Technocracy's starports. There they can hide amongst the heavy traffic, and there the Technocracy can obscure the dealings - its special status of Optronics producers ties up the hands of Guild-associated watchmen.

  STR_WIZ_080_UFOPEDIA: "It is obvious that the Red Mage is not telling us everything, and the Black Mask we've found is a clue that her 'war' could be a much bigger thing than it might look at first. And it is dangerous to immerse yourself into a dark plot blindly. Finding out the story behind the Mask might at least allow us to understand the whole game better, and be able to turn back before any major disaster strikes. Hmm, didn't we already hear about masked mages somewhere...?"
  STR_WIZ_081_UFOPEDIA: "The data storage device we've found at the Technomancer's hideout took some time to decrypt. It details the designs for cyborgization of zombies, apparently to create a grand army. How to feed them with Zombie Juice and Vampire Blood to make them strong, fit and smart (but apparently, not too smart); how to ensure their obedience and make them understand orders; how to adapt cybernetics to their physiology to achieve synergy. The most puzzling parts refer to Shadowtech and Chernobog; the latter being some sort of a command and control network. The details on Shadowtech are scarce, but by the study of Necronomicon, they plan to be able to make the Army of Chernobog travel between dimensions and communicate in a manner completely inscrutable to the Star Gods."

I've been getting trouble from these Chernobog types as well, and it will be more efficient to join forces.

There are many of such libraries of knowledge, and grabbing each will be a solid boost to our fame.{NEWLINE}Data Discs can sometimes be seized from our enemies. Some can contain the data we've mentioned; most others will describe some piece of technology or equipment.{NEWLINE}Much has been lost in this wild world we inhabit. While the Stellar Empire has brought technology, it also took away our means of understanding it. We can tinker, match and mix, but not really improve. We need to find some well-informed allies, as well as to gain the knowledge of Old Earth books - either through Discs (that can only be decrypted here) or random interrogation of anyone who seems smart, and then start the 'Back To School' project."
  STR_PINUP_002_UFOPEDIA: "Be wary of your encumbrance, as it could really slow you down. If the carried weight surpasses a soldier's Strength, you will have less TUs available, and unlike TU penalties incurred by armor, it can even make it impossible to fire weapons. However a soldier can pick up any weight and suffer no ill-effects if the weight is dropped before the end of turn. There is no extra bonus for carrying less than your maximum allowed encumbrance."
  STR_PINUP_003_UFOPEDIA: "Come at them from the back.{NEWLINE}It will reduce any Evasion they might have by half (attacks from the flank reduce it by 1/4th)."
  STR_PINUP_004_UFOPEDIA: "What constitutes beauty is often a complicated matter, but here we simply sum it up as 'beefness'. Beefness, or physical ability is broken into stats: Strength, Health, TUs (speed) and Energy (Stamina). To increase beefness (and thus beauty), you need to train; the lower a stat, the faster it's likely to increase. Working out surely gets you there, but it requires effort. And there is a more fun way: combat. Hitting enemies with ranged and melee weapons or casting magic will not only influence related skills, but also gradually increase your beefness (and thus beauty). Gains are even faster when using 'extra XP' outfits."
  STR_PINUP_005_UFOPEDIA: "The placement of your spare ammo does matter. The TU cost of reloading is increased by the cost of moving ammunition to your hand (as much as 20 if it's in your backpack). You will avoid paying extra TUs only if the spare ammo is in your free hand."
  STR_PINUP_006_UFOPEDIA: "Most Piercing weapons of 60+ Power will always cause some armor damage. Even more armor damage is caused by Plasma weapons, regardless of their Power."
  STR_PINUP_007_UFOPEDIA: "Even if you can't get enough plundering, still take a break every few hours. Savor the anticipation, protect your sanity and let your body regenerate. Or you will die."
  STR_PINUP_008_UFOPEDIA: "Discretion is the better part of valour."
  STR_PINUP_009_UFOPEDIA: "No matter how good you think your armor is, if you're presenting your backside to the enemy, you're asking for it. Even the best armor is usually much more vulnerable from the back, and your Evasion is the worst there as well."
  STR_PINUP_010_UFOPEDIA: "Diversify your weapons."
  STR_PINUP_011_UFOPEDIA: "Strong and skilled melee fighters can destroy anything."
  STR_PINUP_012_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The normal approach speed in dogfight equals 1 km per 4 seconds; when equipped with short-range weapons, you might take as many as 10 enemy blasts before getting into engagement range. Some enemies may flee instead of fighting, as long as the Max Speed of their craft exceeds that of your interceptor."
  STR_PINUP_013_UFOPEDIA: "Do not underestimate skilled, but weak melee fighters. Many of the lighter melee weapons inflict damage based rather on Melee, Reactions or Throwing than Strength, and they're much less tiring to use (melee weapon's swing Energy cost equals 2/3rds of its Weight, rounded down). High Reactions will allow for a frontal charge without being shot at. Thus speed sometimes wins over sheer strength (but having both is the best)."
  STR_PINUP_014_UFOPEDIA: "Armor is only useful to those who get hit."
  STR_PINUP_015_UFOPEDIA: "Maximum level of stun damage is four times the max health, so it might be worth it to inflict extra stun on a fallen enemy. On the other hand, it also means everyone can be revived... sooner or later. Stun also causes Energy drain (20% of its value), so don't be surprised that a freshly woken Gal has little Energy..."

When going under a low ceiling, kneel to see elevated enemies and be able to throw bombs further away. Standing on corpses brings bad luck."
  STR_PINUP_020_UFOPEDIA: "Don't panic: any explosive can be unprimed. This operation usually costs 25% of your TUs."
  STR_PINUP_021_UFOPEDIA: "Cut and Stab damage, inflicted by weapons like knives and bows, causes very little extra Stun damage (half as much as bullets).{NEWLINE}However, such weapons sometimes can cause Reactions Disrupt or Extra Pain, which inflict, respectively, TU and Morale damage proportional to HP damage caused."
  STR_PINUP_022_UFOPEDIA: "Certain underhanded monsters (usually the tentacled ones and witches, or, worst case, tentacled witches) will use attacks based on Charm damage, that sometimes also destroy armor. Pink-hazed landscapes are a sure sign of environmental hazards similar in nature. Resistance to Charm damage will be the key in dealing with them, which usually means the less clothing, the better. Bringing along stims is also recommended."
  STR_PINUP_023_UFOPEDIA: "Chem can melt your opponent right out of their armor. All chem weapons cause armor damage equal to 0-20% of their Power, before armor's defense is even considered, unless otherwise stated in the Pedia. This makes subsequent shots more effective. The effect stacks with armor damage caused by any penetrating hits, if applicable. Chem also causes moderate Morale damage. However, the tradeoff is less armor penetration (usually 33%)."
  STR_PINUP_024_UFOPEDIA: "Running is faster than walking, but you won't automatically stop upon seeing an enemy, allowing them an unopposed Reactions check."
  STR_PINUP_025_UFOPEDIA: "Clothing and armor made for humans and normal-sized mutants is too small for Uber gals to wear, at least in battle! Most outfits can be worn by only a single race of warriors, but exceptions exist. When in doubt, try until it fits someone!"
  STR_PINUP_026_UFOPEDIA: "The gals will be hurting when wounded, whether you like it or not! And it's not a good kind of hurt!{NEWLINE}Health damage does not only reduce combat skills, it also affects Stun and Energy recovery. When you're seriously wounded, you will be suffering constant Stun damage, and your Combat skills will be reduced by up to 25%, proportionally to health loss. This affects all human-like creatures."
  STR_PINUP_027_UFOPEDIA: "You can switch craft's weapons off and on by clicking their icons during an air battle."
  STR_PINUP_028_UFOPEDIA: "Lethal weapons cause so-called System Shock damage, which is extra stun damage, normally equal to 0-50% of HP damage inflicted. If a weapon description says, eg.

  STR_PINUP_070_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}Resistances are sometimes far more important than armor values. Items of Resistance are more powerful than you might think."
  STR_PINUP_071_UFOPEDIA: "Not all weapons are equally effective against armored enemies. Eg. 'armor +25%'. This means that after the damage is rolled, and multiplied by appropriate Resistance value, armor value of the target is multiplied by 1.25, before being subtracted from damage. If it said '-25%', then target's armor would be multiplied by .75. Some damage types fully ignore armor by default (Charm, Burn, Choking, Hot, Cold). A weapon that both damages and reduces armor is dangerous, because the former occurs before the latter. Especially an area weapon against 2x2 units, as it inflicts 4 separate hits on them."
  STR_PINUP_072_UFOPEDIA: "Interrogations increase our knowledge, and the prisoners, released after being interrogated, spread the word about our ferocity, wealth and power.

  STR_PINUP_078_UFOPEDIA: "Firing when in enemy melee range (directly adjacent to any enemy) is governed by different rules than ranged shots. A special Close Combat Check is rolled, using 1/2 Melee + 1/2 Reactions, times weapon's CQ Accuracy modifier (average 85%). Evasion (if any) of the enemy closest to gal's front is subtracted from that value. Note that this check is performed always, regardless if you're targeting the enemy in melee range, or anything else."
  STR_PINUP_079_UFOPEDIA: "Holding SHIFT+CTRL when selecting target for autofire enters the Spray Fire mode, where you can select 2 (sometimes 3) waypoints.
